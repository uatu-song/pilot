**CHAPTER 11: THE QUIET**

---

The door closes.

Standard stands in the center of the room and listens to the silence eat itself.

It is not like other silences. The silence in the Rover was thick, padded with engine hum and the rasp of breathing. The silence at the checkpoint was anticipatory — the held breath before a scream. This silence is absolute. It is a silence that has killed all the other sounds and is now waiting to see what survives.

She does not move.

The room is small. Eight feet by eight feet — she will measure later, when she can make herself walk. The walls are covered in gray panels, textured like the surface of an egg carton, and they swallow the sound of her breathing before it can reach her own ears. The floor is metal grating. Cold under her bare feet. They took her boots. They took everything.

The gown is thin. Paper, maybe, or something that wants to be paper. It ties at the back and gaps at the sides and it is not enough to keep out the chill, but she is not shivering. She notices this. Notes it. Files it with the other things she doesn't understand.

There is a cot against the wall. Thin padding. No pillow. No blanket.

There is nothing else.

Standard sits on the cot. The padding compresses under her weight with a faint crinkle that dies before it finishes. She places her hands on her knees. She looks at the wall.

She waits.

---

Time passes. She thinks it passes. There is no way to measure it here — no light changing, no sounds from outside, no clock. Just the gray walls and the cold floor and the silence that isn't silence anymore.

Because something is humming.

It isn't in the room. She checked. She walked the perimeter — eight steps by eight steps, she was right — and pressed her palms against every panel, feeling for vibration. Nothing. The walls are dead. The floor is dead. The cot is dead.

The hum is inside her.

It lives in her chest, below her heart, in the space where breath doesn't quite reach. It has been there since the checkpoint — since the violet light, since the thing that rummaged through her and left something behind. But out there, in the world, it was quiet. Background noise. Easy to ignore under the engine and the wind and Elena's voice and the thousand small sounds of being alive.

Here, there is nothing to mask it.

Standard presses her hand to her sternum. The hum doesn't change. It isn't responding to her touch. It isn't responding to anything. It just... continues. A vibration without source. A frequency without sound.

She doesn't know what it is.

She doesn't know how to make it stop.

---

She counts her breaths for a while. It gives her something to do. Fourteen. Fifteen. Twenty. Thirty-one. The numbers are arbitrary — she has no baseline, no sense of how long a breath should take — but the counting helps. It is a structure. A rhythm she can hold onto while everything else dissolves.

Her fingers trace the seam of the gown. Back and forth. Back and forth. The texture is rough and cheap and wrong against her skin, but the motion is soothing in a way she can't explain.

She thinks about Elena.

The memory comes without permission: Elena standing in the courtyard after the doors closed. Her face. The way her armor crumbled — not the physical kind, but the other kind. The thing she had been building since the checkpoint, the story she was trying to tell. *She walked through the Drop. The drones left her alone. She's a sign.*

It wasn't enough. Ash saw through it. Or saw something else entirely.

*Your daughter is grieving.*

Standard said that. She doesn't know why. The words came from somewhere deep, from the same place the hum lives now, and she couldn't stop them. Couldn't even slow them down.

*She has your face. But not your frequency.*

She said that too.

She doesn't know what it means. She doesn't know whose words they were. They felt old. They felt borrowed. They felt like something she swallowed a long time ago and forgot until the silence squeezed them out of her.

---

The hum is louder now.

Standard lies on the cot, staring at the ceiling, and feels it spreading. It started in her chest but it is moving — into her shoulders, down her arms, pooling in her fingertips like heat. Not painful. Just... present. Insistent. Like something trying to get her attention.

She closes her eyes.

The dark behind her eyelids is different from the dark of the room. Warmer. More alive. She can feel her pulse there, or something that wants to be her pulse, and the hum weaves through it like thread through fabric.

She sees something.

Not a memory. Not exactly. A flash — a woman's face, dark hair, tired eyes, a smile that doesn't reach. She is saying something Standard can't hear. She is reaching out, her hand cupped around something small, and Standard knows — *knows* without knowing how — that the small thing is important. That it matters more than anything else in the world.

Then the image is gone.

Standard opens her eyes. The ceiling is gray. The walls are gray. The silence presses against her like a hand.

She doesn't recognize the woman. She doesn't know whose memory that was.

But her chest aches, sudden and sharp, and her eyes are wet, and she doesn't know why.

---

She sits up.

The ache doesn't fade. It spreads, the way the hum spread, until her whole body feels heavy with it. She presses her palm to her sternum again and this time she pushes — hard, as if she could reach inside and pull the thing out.

Nothing happens. The hum continues. The ache continues.

But something shifts.

It is small. A settling, like sediment in water. The hum doesn't stop but it changes — finds a pitch, locks into it. And with the pitch comes a word.

Not a word she knows. Not English, not any language she recognizes. It sits in her mouth like a stone — heavy, angular, wrong. She couldn't pronounce it if she tried. She doesn't know what it means.

But it is *hers* now. Or she is its.

Standard stands. She walks to the wall — the one facing the door — and places both palms flat against the padding.

"Let me out."

Her voice is strange in the silence. It dies against the panels without echo, without resonance, but she feels it vibrate through her hands. Through her arms. Through the thing in her chest.

No one answers. She didn't expect anyone to answer.

She says it again anyway.

"Let me out."

The hum pulses. Once. Like a heartbeat. Like agreement.

---

She doesn't know how long she stands there. Minutes. Hours. The cold seeps into her feet, up through her ankles, but she doesn't move. She keeps her hands on the wall and she breathes and she waits.

The woman's face comes again. Clearer this time. The dark hair is streaked with gray. The tired eyes are wet. She is saying something — Standard can almost hear it now, almost catch the shape of the words — and she is crying.

*Mija.*

The word surfaces like a bubble in still water. Standard doesn't know what it means. She knows it is Spanish, maybe, or something close to Spanish, and she knows it is tender. A word for someone loved.

She knows it is not for her.

But she holds it anyway. Cups it in her mind the way the woman in the memory cupped the small thing in her hands. It is a gift she doesn't understand. A piece of a story she wasn't part of.

The hum settles. Quiets. Not gone — just waiting.

Standard takes her hands off the wall. She looks at them. The cuticles are healing. The blood is gone. They look like her hands now, not like evidence of something she forgot.

She walks back to the cot. Sits down. Folds her hands in her lap.

She is still waiting. She is still alone. But something has changed. Something in her chest, in the space where the hum lives, has clicked into place. A gear finding its track. A key halfway turned.

She doesn't know what door it opens.

She is patient. She will find out.

---

The door opens.

Not her door — somewhere else in the building. She feels it through the floor, a faint vibration that shouldn't be possible through all the dampening. She feels it through the hum in her chest, which stirs, attentive, like an animal scenting the wind.

Someone is coming.

Standard doesn't stand. Doesn't prepare. She sits on the cot with her hands in her lap and she watches the door and she waits.

The footsteps approach. Stop.

The lock disengages — mechanical, heavy. The door swings inward.

Light spills across the floor, harsh and clinical after all the gray. Standard squints against it. She can see a silhouette in the doorway. Small. Slight. Familiar.

"Standard."

Elena's voice is hoarse. Cracked. She looks like she hasn't slept — or like she slept and woke worse than before.

"We need to go," Elena says. "Now."

Standard doesn't move.

"Hendricks is in the pit. They're going to execute him at dawn." Elena steps into the cell, her boots loud on the metal grating. "And my father — he's not going to let you leave this room. Not ever. He thinks you're—"

She stops. Stares.

"What happened to you?"

Standard doesn't know how to answer. She doesn't know what Elena is seeing. She only knows that the hum in her chest is quiet now, patient, and the word she swallowed — the one she can't pronounce — is sitting at the base of her tongue like a promise.

"I heard something," Standard says. "While I was waiting."

"Heard what?"

Standard considers the question. She looks at her hands. She looks at Elena — at the cracks in her armor, at the fear she's trying to hide, at the girl underneath the soldier.

"A name," Standard says. "I think it was a name."

She stands. The gown rustles. The cold floor bites at her feet.

"Take me to Hendricks."

Elena stares at her a moment longer — that look, the one Standard still doesn't understand, the mix of fear and wonder and something else — and then she nods.

"This way. And don't make a sound."

Standard follows her out of the cell, into the corridor, into the light. The hum in her chest is singing now, low and steady, and the word sits on her tongue, and somewhere in the back of her mind the woman with the tired eyes is still reaching out, still offering something Standard can't yet receive.

She doesn't know what she is.

But she is starting to learn.
