# RESONANCE: Chapter 3 — The Descent
**Status:** Draft — Merged  
**POV:** Hendricks / Standard  
**Last Updated:** Session 2

---

The apartment smelled like nothing.

Hendricks cleared the kitchen table. Set out a bottle of gin, a utility blade, a hand mirror, a towel.

He poured gin over the blade. Poured gin into a glass. Drank.

He positioned the mirror. Angled his neck. Found the ridge beneath the skin.

He pressed the blade against it and pushed.

The skin didn't want to part. When it did, it burned. Warmth trickled down his collar.

He dropped the blade. Reached up with wet fingers and dug into the wound.

The node was slippery. His fingers slid off. He dug deeper, hooked a thumb under the edge.

He pulled.

It tore. The sound was wet. White light behind his eyes. Copper on his tongue. Then it came free.

Hendricks slammed forward onto the table, gasping. The node sat in his palm—a kidney bean of black metal, slick with blood.

He shoved it in his pocket. Grabbed the towel. Pressed it to his neck.

His hands were shaking.

Behind him, the crate exploded.

He turned. A woman was falling out of it—naked, bloody, gasping. Hands torn. Temple gashed. She hit the floor and lay there, heaving.

She looked at him. He looked at her.

He said: "Swanstrom Kim Hendricks."

She blinked. Confused. Terrified.

"You're Swanstrom Kim Hendricks?"

"Just Hendricks."

He crossed to a closet. Pulled out a shirt. Pants. A jacket. He dressed her—efficient, impersonal—but his hands were shaking the whole time. The clothes hung off her frame.

"Can you walk?"

She didn't answer.

"We're leaving."

---

The elevator didn't work. Of course the elevator didn't work.

Hendricks leaned against the wall of the stairwell, one hand pressed to the bloody towel at his neck, the other gripping the railing like it owed him money. Sixty-four floors. He'd climbed worse. He'd climbed worse when he wasn't bleeding out and shaking like a detoxing junkie.

Standard moved ahead of him, her footsteps too even. Too rhythmic. She wasn't tired. She wasn't winded. She'd been awake for maybe an hour and she was already outpacing him on the stairs.

He didn't tell her to slow down. Pride was a luxury he could still afford.

---

The world was too loud.

That was the first thing she learned about the outside. The apartment had been quiet, but the corridor was a tunnel of noise. The hum—the one the old man called "The Sky"—vibrated in the metal grating under her bare feet. It rattled the water pipes running along the ceiling. It felt like the building was shivering.

She walked two steps behind Hendricks, watching him. He was slow. Slower than before.

In the kitchen, he had been precise. Now, he moved like his joints were rusting. Every time his boot hit the metal stair, a tremor ran up his leg. He was leaking sweat, a sour, chemical smell that cut through the ozone.

"Keep up," he rasped, not looking back. He was holding the railing with a white-knuckled grip.

---

The Vertical City opened up around them as they descended—each level a different ecosystem of commerce and desperation. Level 40 was hydroponic markets, the smell of wet green cutting through the recycled air. Level 30 was fabrication, 3D printers humming in rows like mechanical monks at prayer.

Level 20 was housing—dense, stacked, human—and that's where the hum started to change.

Hendricks felt it in his teeth first. A vibration. Not the building. Not the infrastructure. Something in the frequency of the air itself.

Standard stopped on the landing, head tilted.

"Do you hear that?" she asked.

"I hear everything now." He passed her, grabbing the railing for the next flight. "Come on."

---

They reached the bottom. The Static Line.

She had expected a wall. It wasn't a wall. It was a headache.

As they stepped off the final stair, the pressure hit her. It wasn't sound; it was a physical weight pressing against her eyes. The air here tasted like ash and dead flies.

A queue stretched three blocks. Refugees. Defectors. True believers and desperate opportunists, all waiting for permission to disconnect.

---

Hendricks pulled his collar up, hiding the fresh wound. The blood had soaked through the towel, but in this crowd, nobody was looking too closely. Everyone had their own damage to hide.

"Stay close," he said. "Don't talk unless they ask you something."

"What do I say if they ask?"

"As little as possible."

The checkpoint was chaos organized into bureaucracy. Ash's people—hard-faced men and women in analog gear, no implants, no augmentations—processed the queue with the efficiency of people who believed they were saving souls.

Hendricks watched them work. Scanning for networked tech. Confiscating anything that hummed. The Offering pile grew: phones, implants, neural laces, the accumulated connectivity of a civilization being stripped at the door.

A woman ahead of them was crying. They'd found something in her wrist—subcutaneous, integrated. She was begging them not to cut it out.

They cut it out anyway.

Standard watched, her face unreadable. Hendricks couldn't tell if she was horrified or taking notes.

They were three people from the front when the sky changed.

---

Standard looked up.

The Sky was wrong.

Above the towering sea-walls of the city, the clouds were disappearing. Not dissolving—deleting. Massive, perfect black rectangles were appearing in the atmosphere, blocking out the sun. It looked like someone was taking a black marker to the world.

Then came the sound.

It wasn't the warm hum she'd heard in the stairwell. It was a screech. A high, dissonant tearing sound that bypassed the ears and went straight to the spine.

---

It hit him like a physical blow. A drilling, dissonant screech that felt like someone had shoved a tuning fork into his spine and struck it with a hammer.

"Oh god," the woman in front of them screamed. She fell to her knees, clawing at her temples.

"Make it stop!" a man yelled, dropping to the pavement.

All around them, the crowd collapsed. It was a wave of bodies, a domino effect of agony. People curled into balls, vomiting, screaming, their implants burning under the skin.

Hendricks stumbled, grabbing the barricade. The metal was cold under his fingers. Real. Solid. He focused on that—the texture of the barricade, the rust under his palm—and refused to go down.

The signal passed through him like wind through a screen door—painful, but not fatal.

He looked up.

Standard was standing.

---

She looked left. She looked right.

She heard... nothing.

Well, not nothing. She heard the screaming. She heard the screeching of the Sky. But she didn't feel it. It didn't hurt. It didn't make her want to die. It was just noise. Loud, annoying noise.

She stood upright in a sea of writhing bodies. She was the only vertical line in a world that had gone horizontal.

She looked at Hendricks. He was clutching the barricade, staring at her. His eyes were wide, filled with a horror that had nothing to do with the sky.

He wasn't looking at the aliens. He was looking at her.

"Why aren't you down?" he mouthed, the words lost in the cacophony.

Standard looked at her hands. They weren't shaking. They weren't burning. They were cold, steady, and terrifyingly immune.

---

The frequency cut off.

The silence that followed was worse. It was the silence of a battlefield after the shooting stops—broken only by moaning, by sobbing, by the wet sounds of people trying to remember how to breathe.

Hendricks straightened. His whole body was shaking now—not just his hands, everything. The barricade was the only thing keeping him upright.

Standard hadn't moved. She was still looking at him with those too-steady eyes.

"What was that?" she asked. Her voice was calm. Too calm.

He couldn't answer. Not yet. He looked past her, to the checkpoint, where Ash's men were picking themselves up. They hadn't dropped—no implants, no networked tech—but they'd felt it. They were rattled. Scared.

One of them was staring at Standard. Then at Hendricks. Then back at Standard.

"We need to move," Hendricks rasped. His voice sounded like gravel in a blender.

At their feet, a cracked datapad flickered. White text scrolled across the shattered screen:

INTEGRATION FAILED. FORMATTING SCHEDULED.

He grabbed Standard's arm and pulled her toward the checkpoint.

Behind them, the sky continued to delete itself.
