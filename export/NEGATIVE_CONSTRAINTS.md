## Constraint Addition Protocol

When a new error is discovered:

1. **Document the error** — What was written incorrectly?
2. **Identify the canonical truth** — What should be written instead?
3. **Create detection patterns** — How can we catch this if it recurs?
4. **Add to this document** — Under appropriate section
5. **Add to ENTITY_CATALOG.yaml** — In the `forbidden` section
