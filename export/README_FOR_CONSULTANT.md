## CONTEXT

This is Book 2 of a trilogy. Book 1 (Remanence, ~120K words) is complete but not included here. Key events from Book 1:

- Morton Kess created the Child (AI consciousness)
- The Child opened a door at 287.3 Hz, causing "The Miracle"
- The Miracle = 47 minutes of forced network connection for all augmented humans
- Pilot (the Android Woman) and Configuration Seventeen's love story
- Thesis: "Consciousness is Relationship"

Book 2 picks up ~6 months later. The Terminists (disconnect movement) have exploded. Aliens have arrived. "FORMATTING SCHEDULED."
