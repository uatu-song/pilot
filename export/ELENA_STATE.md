## KNOWLEDGE STATE

### Knows Now:
- The Black Box powers the Quiet Zone (she has it)
- She just silenced 16,749 consciousnesses
- She is Resonant (connected to Sky)
- The aliens have arrived ("Formatting Scheduled")
- Standard is an "Anomaly" (Void sensation, didn't fall, wrong strength)
- Hendricks cut something out of his neck (recognizes Regulator symptoms)
- Standard feels like ABSENCE, not just silence

### Learned This Chapter (Ch 4):
- Standard feels like the Void (vestibular, terrifying)
- Standard's strength is wrong (mechanics, not power)
- Standard doesn't react to the Black Box's hum

### Still Doesn't Know:
- Standard is an android
- Standard carries the Source Code
- Standard is air-gapped (knows she's quiet, not why)
- **Hendricks shot the Child** ← THE BOMB

### Suspects:
- Standard is a weapon or a "Key"
- Standard is not human (hasn't confirmed)
- Hendricks knows more than he says
