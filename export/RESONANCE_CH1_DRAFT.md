# RESONANCE: Chapter 1 — The Wake Up
**Status:** Draft in Progress  
**POV:** Standard  
**Last Updated:** Session 2 — Author Revision

---

A drilling high-pitch in her ears and she awakens, if this counts as awake, wondering if she died.

Or at least everyone thought she was dead. It would explain the pitch black and claustrophobic confinement. She was laying horizontally, as far as she could tell, and only had enough room to slide her forearms along her chest to bring them to her face.

To scream.

To push futilely against six feet of earth. Or was it twelve? It may as well have been a hundred for all the good her arms were able to muster.

Stop crying.

But she couldn't stop crying and grunting while she tried to ignore the sensations of her fingertips bleeding from cuticles—some torn, some exposing nail beds—until even in her panic she stopped clawing, and eventually, stops crying.

She closed her eyes for some reason, even though she couldn't see the casket door inches from her nose, as she forced her heaving breaths to grind into a less expensive respiration; it was only logical there would only be so much she could take in before she couldn't, before she'd really earn her current place.

Stop crying!

The realization dawned on her that she had limited time but tried to push it aside as she focused on slowing everything down.

In. Hold. Out. Hold. In. Fill chest and diaphragm. Hold. Out. Slow—4—5.

She opened her eyes.

Okay.

It was a hefty price tag in whatever remaining air there was in her encasement but in order to thrive, one first needed to survive; to think, to solve the problem at hand.

Instead of pounding, pushing, and scratching, she felt, with her fingers—ruined now, the pads raw and weeping where skin had peeled back—but no less sensitive to the surface she began to investigate, to search, to—

What—what is that?

Some… groove? Seam? She traced it with what remained of her fingertips, dead center, bisecting her from her head to as low as she could reach without bumping her forehead against the confinement.

Okay.

Her hands come together, elbows tight against her sides, and she closes her eyes again. She took a deep breath in and slowed her mind as much as she could.

"Please, God," she uttered.

The prayer hands jab forward, trying like hell to wedge themselves into the groove in the center. Pain shoots straight up through her arms—she felt her palms split against the sharp edge—and clearly registers but another part of her is telling it to shut the fuck up.

Her voice goes hoarse as it tears through her throat—a sound she doesn't recognize as her own—expending any air remaining in her lungs when, at that moment, her hands breach. She could cry with relief but another part of her is telling her to shut the fuck up. She had to keep going. Finish what she started. 

First, air, blessed air, peeps in. She could feel it refused to be satiated by such a pittance when it was her right to breathe that she wanted to reclaim. 

Then, there was light. She wasn't in hell after all.

Another scream and she fell upward, with such force, the cover which lost the battle of containing her flew off its hinges—the edge catching her temple as she wrenched through, catching her forearms on the lip as she tumbled, her body twisting wrong as it met the floor. She didn't know she was naked until right then, breathing in ragged gasps and through streams of tears, of relief or injustice, she couldn't tell. Something warm ran down the side of her face. Her arms were striped with scrapes, ugly and raw, and her hands—she couldn't look at her hands.

The man at the kitchen table didn't flinch. He was pressing a bloody towel to the back of his neck with one hand, the other flat on the table like he was holding himself upright. His face was pale, sheened with sweat, and his whole body was shaking—a fine tremor that ran from his shoulders down to his fingertips. On the table: a utility blade, a bottle of gin, a hand mirror. Blood on all of it. His eyes tracked her the way someone might watch an unfamiliar dog—not afraid, but calculating the odds of being bitten. He didn't look at her body. He looked at her hands. The gash at her temple. The blood matting her hair. Then, almost imperceptibly, his gaze flicked to the destroyed crate behind her. Something in his expression shifted—not surprise, but the quiet settling of a man who'd just lost a bet with himself.

She noticed him through the blur of tears and pain and stumbled back, grasping at herself to cover her nakedness from this stranger's eyes—even though his remained fixed on the wound at her hairline, on the mess of her, and not on anything else.

He said something. Quiet. Clipped. "Swanstrom Kim Hendricks."

She blinked at him. Tried to focus through the throbbing in her skull. A name. He was giving her his name. An odd one—Scandinavian maybe, or old-world—but she clung to it like a handhold.

"You're Swanstrom Kim Hendricks?"

He was registering her response, not the one he expected. "Just Hendricks."

He grabbed a coat hanging nearby and crossed to her—not rushing, not hesitating—and draped it over her shoulders. The fabric pressed against the scrapes on her arms and she hissed, but the covering was something. A border between her and the room. The coat smelled like him—coffee and something metallic, machine oil maybe, and underneath that, the staleness of a man who lived alone.

"What do I call you?"

Not what's your name. What do I call you. Practical. Like she was a situation to be labeled.

She opened her mouth. Closed it. Her hands—what was left of them—tightened on the coat, leaving smears she tried not to look at.

"I don't—" The words caught. "I don't remember."

The question had hit her like a physical blow. The answer should have been there. It should have been the first thing on the shelf. She reached for it—the shape of herself, the sound her mother used, the signature on a document—and found... nothing. Not a fog. Not a hole. A perfect, smooth, terrifying blankness. She knew the word "table." She knew "coat." She knew "blood." But the file labeled self was empty. Panic spiked again, colder this time. Was this brain damage? Oxygen deprivation? She touched her temple and her fingers came away wet. That couldn't be good.

Hendricks didn't react to her confession. No sympathy. No alarm. Just that same measuring look.

"Sit down."

Not a suggestion. She sat—on the edge of something, a crate or a chair, she didn't look—because her legs were about to give out anyway. He crouched in front of her. Not to comfort. To get a better angle.

"Let me see your hands."

She extended them, palms up, and saw them properly for the first time. The fingertips were raw meat. Two nails were gone entirely, the beds exposed and weeping. Her palms had split along the lines where she'd jammed them into the seam—deep, ugly gashes that should have been screaming with pain but registered as a dull, distant throb.

She looked away. He didn't. He studied them like evidence, turning her wrist, his thumb pressing near the base of her palm as if searching for something. Then his gaze lifted to the wound at her temple, tracking down to the scrapes on her arms, cataloging.

"Does this hurt?"

"Yes." Her voice cracked. "All of it. Yes."

He said nothing. Just released her wrist and stood, crossing to the small kitchen. She heard water running. A moment later he returned with a glass, handed it to her without ceremony. She took it awkwardly, her grip wrong, her fingers not, could not, closing properly around the glass. Drank. Gulped, really—desperate, graceless. Water spilled down her chin, and she didn't care. Still calculating, he watched her throat work, the glass empty and when it was done, her gasping like she'd been drowning all over again.

She went to set the glass down on the surface beside her, and her hand trembled—exhaustion, shock, blood loss maybe—and she fumbled it. The glass slipped, hit the edge, and shattered on the floor. She flinched back from the sound, from the mess, from herself.

"I'm sorry—I didn't—" She looked at the shards, at her ruined hands, at the water spreading across his floor. "I'm sorry."

He didn't reassure her. Didn't explain. Just looked at the broken glass, then back at her, and she could see him filing it away somewhere behind those flat, patient eyes.

Something was wrong with her. Oxygen deprivation. Brain damage. Trauma. That had to be it.

That had to be it.

Hendricks crossed to a closet. His movements were stiff, deliberate—a man holding himself together by force of will. He pulled out a shirt. Pants. A jacket too big in the shoulders. He dressed her like she was cargo being prepared for transport—efficient, impersonal—but his hands were shaking the whole time. The clothes hung off her frame, ill-fitting, borrowed, but they were something. A second skin to replace the one she couldn't trust.

"Can you walk?"

She didn't know. She nodded anyway.

"We're leaving."

## REVISION NOTES

### Session 2 — Restructured:

**Timeline Change:**
- Hendricks now finishing surgery when Standard emerges (not mid-meal)
- Bloody towel, shaking, pale, sweating
- Table holds: utility blade, gin, hand mirror, blood
- Mystery: What the hell happened to this man?
- Answer: Chapter 3 (flashback)

**New Ending:**
- He dresses her in his clothes (ill-fitting, borrowed)
- "Can you walk?" / "We're leaving."
- Momentum doesn't stop—she's born and immediately in motion

**Structural Changes:**
- "Stop crying" now precedes the failure to stop, then escalates to "Stop crying!"
- Internal command → failure → louder command structure
- Semicolons binding related thoughts for faster rhythm
- Tighter paragraph breaks matching panic then forced calm

**New Lines:**
- "She wasn't in hell after all." — spiritual framework, relief, subtle irony on reread

**Intentional Tense Shift:**
- "stops crying" — present tense in past-tense passage
- Functions as directive completing itself, not retrospective narration
- Mirrors Standard's processing: something that needs to happen, not was happening

**Syntactic Choices:**
- "her fingers not, could not, closing properly" — prose stumbles like her grip
- "Still calculating, he watched" — front-loading Hendricks' mode

**Damage Inventory:**
- Cuticles torn, nail beds exposed
- Fingertips raw meat, two nails gone
- Palms split from seam
- Temple gashed
- Forearms scraped
- Blood matting hair
- Hands she can't look at

**Tells Remaining (Subtle):**
- "less expensive respiration"
- "the file labeled self was empty"
- Hendricks searching her palm "as if for something"
- "stops crying" tense shift

**Easter Egg:**
- Shutdown code changed from "Seven November Hendricks" to "Swanstrom Kim Hendricks"
- Swanstrom and Kim = hidden tribute
- Reads as unusual Scandinavian name, not military phonetic
- Deeper disguise, same function

**BSY Subversion Active:**
- Extensive damage eliminates gaze
- Covered quickly, stays covered
- Competence shown (problem-solving in box)
- He withholds, doesn't teach
- No romantic/sexual framing

### Current Word Count: ~1,600
