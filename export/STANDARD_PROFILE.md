# CHARACTER PROFILE: STANDARD

**Role:** Protagonist (The Unwilling Messiah)
**First Appearance:** Chapter 1
**Last Updated:** December 20, 2025 — Session 1

## I. IDENTITY

**Canonical Name:** Standard
**Aliases:** "The Woman," "The Anomaly," "She"
**Demographics:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Gender | Woman (presents as) |
| Apparent Ethnicity | Latina |
| Apparent Age | Adult, unspecified |
| Sexuality | N/A (at this stage) |

**Nature:** Android (Air-gapped, consciousness-capable)

**Ethnicity Note:** NED pattern-matched her appearance to Hendricks' genetic profile (Afro-Latino). Morton designed her *for* Hendricks specifically—she's bespoke, not generic. When they stand together, they read as plausible family or associates.

**One-Line Summary:**

> An air-gapped synthetic consciousness who believes she is a broken human fighting to survive in a world that wants to format her.

---

## II. PSYCHOLOGICAL ENGINE

### The Terror

> **The Terror of Being Unearned.** She believes her feelings are simulated, her soul is a glitch, and she has not suffered enough to be real.

### The Need

> She needs validation from the "Enemy" (Brother Ash) to recognize her suffering as real; self-validation is impossible.

### The Vice

> **Clinical Dissociation.** She processes her own pain and damage as data ("structural integrity degrading") rather than feeling it, distancing herself from her own existence.

### The Mutual Cure

> **Brother Ash.** If he, a human purist, acknowledges her suffering is authentic, the proof of her humanity becomes irrefutable.

## III. ARC

**Book Arc:** "Amnesiac / Broken Human" → "Moral Center / Choice"

| Beat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Awakening | Breaks out of the crate; fails to find "Self" file |
| Denial | Withstands the Correction Frequency; realizes she's different |
| Isolation | "Not just broken... not even part of the species" |
| Discovery | TBD — learns what she is |
| Choice | TBD — decides what to do with the Source Code |

---

## IV. RELATIONSHIPS

### Hendricks — "The Guardian"

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Dynamic | Imprinting / Protective. He was there at her birth; he bleeds for her. |
| Structural | She protects him physically; he protects her truth. |
| Visual | They look like they belong together (pattern-matched ethnicity). |
| Tension | He knows what she is; she doesn't. |

### Elena — "The Driver"

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Dynamic | Stranger / Authority figure |
| Structural | Elena decides where she goes |
| Tension | Standard felt Elena recoil from her presence (The Void) |

### Brother Ash — "The Enemy / The Cure"

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Dynamic | Will become her theological crisis |
| Structural | He represents everything that would deny her personhood |
| Mutual Cure | If he acknowledges her suffering, she can believe herself |

## V. PHYSICAL BASELINE

### Appearance:
- Adult female presentation, Latina
- No visible tech/ports (Air-gapped)
- Pattern-matched to Hendricks—they read as kin

### Tells (Subtle cues for reader):
- "Less expensive respiration" (computational framing)
- "The file labeled self was empty" (data framing)
- "Stops crying" (present tense directive)
- "Four percent. Maybe five." (uncanny precision)
- Eyes refocusing in tiny, mechanical adjustments
- Joint click, almost mechanical
- Cold, steady, terrifyingly immune
- Didn't fall during Correction Frequency

---

## VI. VOICE

### Register:
> Flat, observational, data-driven.

### Speech Patterns:
- Uses medical or structural metaphors ("broken," "integrity") instead of machine ones
- Notices things in percentages or grids
- Present tense directives to self ("Stop crying")
- Memory gaps feel like missing files, not fog

### POV Rules:
- Never call herself a machine/android/robot
- Frame physical sensations clinically
- Memory gaps feel like missing files, not fog
- Learns to curse from Hendricks—uses profanity incorrectly, then too precisely

### Forbidden Phrasings (NEVER use in her POV):
- "Servos," "chassis," "circuits"
- "Rebooting," "malfunctioning"
- "Processor," "system," "hardware"
- "She knew she was a machine"
- "Morton's gift"

---

## VII. CONSTRAINTS

### Blocking (Auto-reject):

| Constraint | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| Standard knows she is a machine | Destroys central mystery engine |
| "Morton's gift" / "Sent by Morton" | Telegraphs origin too early |
| Wakes from Alien Signal | Wakes from 287.3 Hz (Resonance) |
| Machine metaphors in her POV | She doesn't know what she is |

### Warning (Flag for review):

| Constraint | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| Superhuman strength displays | Keep tells subtle; reader should wonder, not know |

### Detection Patterns:
```
- "she knew she was" + (machine|android|robot)
- "Morton's gift"
- "Morton's final gift"
- "chassis"
- "servos"
- "circuits"
- "reboot"
- "malfunction"
```
