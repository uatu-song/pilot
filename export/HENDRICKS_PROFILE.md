## I. IDENTITY

**Canonical Name:** Sabino Hendricks
**Full Name:** Swanstrom Kim Hendricks (shutdown code / name given to Standard)
**Aliases:** "The Old Man," "Hendricks"
**Demographics:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Gender | Man |
| Age | 64 |
| Ethnicity | Afro-Latino (Mexico City Vertical origin) |
| Sexuality | Asexual / Demisexual |

**Nature:** Human (Formerly Augmented, currently un-networked)

**Sexuality Note:** His asexual/demisexual nature supports his "Transactional Isolation" and explains his immunity to the seduction of connection/Hive Mind. He withholds intimacy as practice.

**One-Line Summary:**

> A weary diplomatic fixer who removes his own life-support to smuggle a synthetic consciousness into sanctuary.

---

## II. PSYCHOLOGICAL ENGINE

### The Terror

> **The Burden of Utility.** He fears being useless more than he fears death; spent 40 years as an asset and doesn't know how to be a person.

### The Need

> To choose a loyalty that isn't transactional; to stand *with* someone rather than just handle them.

### The Vice

> **Transactional Isolation.** He withholds connection as practice, using silence as a weapon and treating relationships as negotiations.

### The Mutual Cure

> **Standard.** By protecting her without orders, he moves from being an Executor to a Guardian.
