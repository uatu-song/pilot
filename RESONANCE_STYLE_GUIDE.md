# RESONANCE: PROSE STYLE GUIDE

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** December 28, 2025  
**Purpose:** Canonical reference for Joe's prose voice. Load before any drafting or revision work.

## Core Philosophy

**Voice trumps technical polish.** When grammar and ear conflict, trust the ear. These aren't rules to enforce—they're patterns to recognize and protect.

**Density is a feature.** Every scene is load-bearing. Compressed prose, nothing wasted. Don't add air unless it's earned.

**Embody, don't articulate.** Characters live the theme; they don't explain it. Actions and images carry the weight. The reader infers.

---

## Syntactic Signatures

### Fragment Sentences for Impact

Fragments carry weight. They land as beats, not errors.

```
To scream.

Okay.

Not surprise.

Blood on all of it.
```

Use fragments for:
- Emotional beats
- Realizations
- Sensory punctuation
- Pacing control

**Do not "fix" fragments into complete sentences.**

---

### Internal Commands as Direct Address

The mind talks to itself. Second person, imperative mood, no quotation marks.

```
Stop crying.

Keep going. Finish what you started.

You're not alive yet.
```

This creates intimacy without interiority bloat. The reader is inside the skull.

---

### Body-as-Inventory

Physical damage rendered as clinical list, not purple description. The precision *is* the horror.

```
her fingertips bleeding from the cuticles—some torn, some exposing nail beds

Her arms were striped with scrapes, ugly and raw, and her hands—she can't look at her hands.
```

Notice: enumeration without sentiment. The facts speak.

---

### Lists as Rhythm

Short declarative lists, often colon-introduced, creating staccato inventory.

```
On the table: a utility blade. A bottle of gin. A hand mirror.

Blood on all of it.
```

Period-separated items. Not comma-separated. Each object gets weight.

---

### Single-Sentence Paragraphs

Isolation = emphasis. A sentence alone on a line demands attention.

```
The man at the kitchen table doesn't flinch.

Something in his expression shifts.

Not surprise.
```

Use for:
- POV shifts in attention
- Revelations
- Beats that need to land before moving on

---

### Em-Dashes for Syntactic Pivots

Em-dashes interrupt thought, insert parenthetical detail, or pivot mid-sentence.

```
her fingertips bleeding from the cuticles—some torn, some exposing nail beds—but no less sensitive

the edge caught her temple as she wrenched through, caught her forearms on the lip as she tumbled, her body twisting wrong as it meets the floor
```

Em-dashes are interruptions. Commas are pauses. Know the difference.

---

### Vernacular in Interiority

Characters think the way they'd talk. Including profanity. Including ungrammatical constructions.

```
another part of her is telling it to shut the fuck up

She didn't know she was naked until right then
```

Don't sanitize internal monologue into formal prose.

---

### Observation as Character Revelation

What a character notices reveals who they are. The *selection* of detail is characterization.

```
The quiet settling of a man who has just lost a bet with himself.

He's tracking the damage like he was reading a report.
```

The POV character's interpretive frame shapes the prose. Analytical characters count. Traumatized characters threat-assess. Anxious characters notice exits.

---

## Tense Architecture

**Resonance uses present tense.** This is architectural, not arbitrary.

- **Remanence:** Past tense (stories being remembered)
- **Resonance:** Present tense (events being recorded)
- **Renaissance:** Future tense (prophecy being declared)

### Within Present-Tense Narration

Past perfect and past tense are correct for completed prior events:

```
NED had shuttered after their CEO was murdered forty stories above.

Even though the few humans... left as soon as they could once the Miracle occurred...
```

These events happened before the narrative present. Past tense is correct.

**The wobble to watch for:** Ongoing conditions described in past tense when they should be present.

- ✗ "the building's automated units continued doing" (implies they stopped)
- ✓ "the building's automated units continue doing" (they're still at it)

**But:** If you're narrating the historical persistence—"everyone left and they kept cleaning"—past tense captures the *fact* of their continuation, not their current state. Context determines which is right.

**When in doubt:** Read it aloud. Does it sound like the narrator is describing now or then?

---

## Intentional Repetition

Repetition for emphasis stays. Don't "fix" what's deliberate.

```
once the Miracle occurred, once the world changed forever
```

The doubled "once" is rhythmic, not redundant. It sounds right. That's the test.

**Detection:** If you wrote it because you heard it that way, defend it. If you wrote it because you forgot you already said it, cut it.

---

## Textural vs. Focal Details

Not every detail demands attention. Some belong in subordinate clauses—peripheral spice absorbed unconsciously.

```
His suit, losing rigidity, folds in on itself like a puppet with cut strings while a vac-bot scoots by them.
```

The vac-bot is *texture*—the world's indifference during violence. It doesn't need its own sentence. It shouldn't be emphasized. It rewards attentive readers without demanding focus.

**Focal details** get their own beat:
```
A vac-bot scoots past them.
```

**Textural details** stay subordinate:
```
...while a vac-bot scoots by them.
```

Choose based on whether you want the reader to *notice* or *absorb*.

---

## Pacing Mechanics

### Fast (Action, Tension)

- Short sentences (5-10 words)
- Fragments
- Heavy dialogue
- Minimal description
- One beat per paragraph

```
His body seizes. His rifle clatters. His hands claw at his helmet—frantic, useless.
```

### Slow (Breathing Room)

- Longer sentences
- Descriptive passages
- Internal monologue
- Scene-setting

Use sparingly. The default is compression.

---

## Dialogue Principles

### Subtext Over Statement

Characters rarely say what they mean directly.

✗ On the nose:
```
"I'm angry that you lied to me."
```

✓ With subtext:
```
"The numbers in your report." She set the file down too carefully. "They're interesting."
```

### Action Beats Over Tags

```
"This is insane." Sarah closed the file. "But the data's clear."
```

Not:
```
"This is insane," Sarah said, closing the file. "But the data's clear," she added.
```

### Contractions Are Default

"Won't," "she'd," "they're"—unless the character is formal or non-native.

### Keep It Snappy

Most lines under 150 characters. Break grammar rules: fragments, interruptions, trailing off.

## What to Protect During Revision

When reviewing AI-assisted drafts or self-editing, watch for:

1. **Fragment "corrections"** — Don't let complete sentences replace intentional fragments
2. **Repetition removal** — Verify it's accidental before cutting
3. **Tense "fixes"** — Past perfect for prior events is correct within present narration
4. **Subordinate detail promotion** — Not everything needs emphasis
5. **Vernacular sanitization** — Keep profanity and informal syntax in interiority
6. **List reformatting** — Period-separated inventories aren't errors

---

## The Revision Conversation

When working with AI collaborators on revision:

### Expect Over-Correction

AI drafting tends toward:
- Completing fragments
- Removing "redundant" repetition
- Smoothing syntactic roughness
- Adding transitions

Push back. Defend what sounds right.

### Provide Surgical Instructions

Specify what to cut vs. preserve:
- "Keep the fragment structure in paragraph 3"
- "The doubled 'once' is intentional"
- "The vac-bot stays subordinate—don't give it its own sentence"

### Voice > Polish

If a "fix" makes the prose technically cleaner but flattens the voice, reject it.

---

## Negative Style Constraints

### Never

- Heavy interiority explaining character feelings
- Authorial poetry that doesn't match POV voice
- Telegraphing themes explicitly
- Exposition through dialogue ("As you know, Bob...")
- Lecture-mode speeches about inequality/philosophy
- Characters who exist only to be convinced

### Always

- Actions demonstrate feelings
- Voice matches character
- Trust the reader to infer
- Every character believes something defensible
- The uncertainty is the point (re: Standard's interiority)

---

## Quick Reference Checklist

Before submitting/approving any prose:

- [ ] Fragments preserved where intentional?
- [ ] Tense architecture intact (present narrative, past for prior events)?
- [ ] Intentional repetition defended?
- [ ] Textural details still subordinate?
- [ ] Internal monologue in character's actual voice?
- [ ] Subtext over statement in dialogue?
- [ ] Actions carrying emotional weight (not exposition)?
- [ ] POV filter shaping what's noticed/missed?

---

## The Golden Rule

**Would Joe hear it this way?**

If yes → it stays.  
If no → it goes.

The prose has a voice. Protect it.
