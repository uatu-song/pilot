    "RESONANCE_STYLE_GUIDE.md": "# RESONANCE: PROSE STYLE GUIDE\n\n**Version:** 1.0  \n**Last Updated:** December 28, 2025  \n**Purpose:** Canonical reference for Joe's prose voice. Load before any drafting or revision work.\n\n---\n\n## Core Philosophy\n\n**Voice trumps technical polish.** When grammar and ear conflict, trust the ear. These aren't rules to enforce—they're patterns to recognize and protect.\n\n**Density is a feature.** Every scene is load-bearing. Compressed prose, nothing wasted. Don't add air unless it's earned.\n\n**Embody, don't articulate.** Characters live the theme; they don't explain it. Actions and images carry the weight. The reader infers.\n\n---\n\n## Syntactic Signatures\n\n### Fragment Sentences for Impact\n\nFragments carry weight. They land as beats, not errors.\n\n```\nTo scream.\n\nOkay.\n\nNot surprise.\n\nBlood on all of it.\n```\n\nUse fragments for:\n- Emotional beats\n- Realizations\n- Sensory punctuation\n- Pacing control\n\n**Do not \"fix\" fragments into complete sentences.**\n\n---\n\n### Internal Commands as Direct Address\n\nThe mind talks to itself. Second person, imperative mood, no quotation marks.\n\n```\nStop crying.\n\nKeep going. Finish what you started.\n\nYou're not alive yet.\n```\n\nThis creates intimacy without interiority bloat. The reader is inside the skull.\n\n---\n\n### Body-as-Inventory\n\nPhysical damage rendered as clinical list, not purple description. The precision *is* the horror.\n\n```\nher fingertips bleeding from the cuticles—some torn, some exposing nail beds\n\nHer arms were striped with scrapes, ugly and raw, and her hands—she can't look at her hands.\n```\n\nNotice: enumeration without sentiment. The facts speak.\n\n---\n\n### Lists as Rhythm\n\nShort declarative lists, often colon-introduced, creating staccato inventory.\n\n```\nOn the table: a utility blade. A bottle of gin. A hand mirror.\n\nBlood on all of it.\n```\n\nPeriod-separated items. Not comma-separated. Each object gets weight.\n\n---\n\n### Single-Sentence Paragraphs\n\nIsolation = emphasis. A sentence alone on a line demands attention.\n\n```\nThe man at the kitchen table doesn't flinch.\n\nSomething in his expression shifts.\n\nNot surprise.\n```\n\nUse for:\n- POV shifts in attention\n- Revelations\n- Beats that need to land before moving on\n\n---\n\n### Em-Dashes for Syntactic Pivots\n\nEm-dashes interrupt thought, insert parenthetical detail, or pivot mid-sentence.\n\n```\nher fingertips bleeding from the cuticles—some torn, some exposing nail beds—but no less sensitive\n\nthe edge caught her temple as she wrenched through, caught her forearms on the lip as she tumbled, her body twisting wrong as it meets the floor\n```\n\nEm-dashes are interruptions. Commas are pauses. Know the difference.\n\n---\n\n### Vernacular in Interiority\n\nCharacters think the way they'd talk. Including profanity. Including ungrammatical constructions.\n\n```\nanother part of her is telling it to shut the fuck up\n\nShe didn't know she was naked until right then\n```\n\nDon't sanitize internal monologue into formal prose.\n\n---\n\n### Observation as Character Revelation\n\nWhat a character notices reveals who they are. The *selection* of detail is characterization.\n\n```\nThe quiet settling of a man who has just lost a bet with himself.\n\nHe's tracking the damage like he was reading a report.\n```\n\nThe POV character's interpretive frame shapes the prose. Analytical characters count. Traumatized characters threat-assess. Anxious characters notice exits.\n\n---\n\n## Tense Architecture\n\n**Resonance uses present tense.** This is architectural, not arbitrary.\n\n- **Remanence:** Past tense (stories being remembered)\n- **Resonance:** Present tense (events being recorded)\n- **Renaissance:** Future tense (prophecy being declared)\n\n### Within Present-Tense Narration\n\nPast perfect and past tense are correct for completed prior events:\n\n```\nNED had shuttered after their CEO was murdered forty stories above.\n\nEven though the few humans... left as soon as they could once the Miracle occurred...\n```\n\nThese events happened before the narrative present. Past tense is correct.\n\n**The wobble to watch for:** Ongoing conditions described in past tense when they should be present.\n\n- ✗ \"the building's automated units continued doing\" (implies they stopped)\n- ✓ \"the building's automated units continue doing\" (they're still at it)\n\n**But:** If you're narrating the historical persistence—\"everyone left and they kept cleaning\"—past tense captures the *fact* of their continuation, not their current state. Context determines which is right.\n\n**When in doubt:** Read it aloud. Does it sound like the narrator is describing now or then?\n\n---\n\n## Intentional Repetition\n\nRepetition for emphasis stays. Don't \"fix\" what's deliberate.\n\n```\nonce the Miracle occurred, once the world changed forever\n```\n\nThe doubled \"once\" is rhythmic, not redundant. It sounds right. That's the test.\n\n**Detection:** If you wrote it because you heard it that way, defend it. If you wrote it because you forgot you already said it, cut it.\n\n---\n\n## Textural vs. Focal Details\n\nNot every detail demands attention. Some belong in subordinate clauses—peripheral spice absorbed unconsciously.\n\n```\nHis suit, losing rigidity, folds in on itself like a puppet with cut strings while a vac-bot scoots by them.\n```\n\nThe vac-bot is *texture*—the world's indifference during violence. It doesn't need its own sentence. It shouldn't be emphasized. It rewards attentive readers without demanding focus.\n\n**Focal details** get their own beat:\n```\nA vac-bot scoots past them.\n```\n\n**Textural details** stay subordinate:\n```\n...while a vac-bot scoots by them.\n```\n\nChoose based on whether you want the reader to *notice* or *absorb*.\n\n---\n\n## Pacing Mechanics\n\n### Fast (Action, Tension)\n\n- Short sentences (5-10 words)\n- Fragments\n- Heavy dialogue\n- Minimal description\n- One beat per paragraph\n\n```\nHis body seizes. His rifle clatters. His hands claw at his helmet—frantic, useless.\n```\n\n### Slow (Breathing Room)\n\n- Longer sentences\n- Descriptive passages\n- Internal monologue\n- Scene-setting\n\nUse sparingly. The default is compression.\n\n---\n\n## Dialogue Principles\n\n### Subtext Over Statement\n\nCharacters rarely say what they mean directly.\n\n✗ On the nose:\n```\n\"I'm angry that you lied to me.\"\n```\n\n✓ With subtext:\n```\n\"The numbers in your report.\" She set the file down too carefully. \"They're interesting.\"\n```\n\n### Action Beats Over Tags\n\n```\n\"This is insane.\" Sarah closed the file. \"But the data's clear.\"\n```\n\nNot:\n```\n\"This is insane,\" Sarah said, closing the file. \"But the data's clear,\" she added.\n```\n\n### Contractions Are Default\n\n\"Won't,\" \"she'd,\" \"they're\"—unless the character is formal or non-native.\n\n### Keep It Snappy\n\nMost lines under 150 characters. Break grammar rules: fragments, interruptions, trailing off.\n\n---\n\n## What to Protect During Revision\n\nWhen reviewing AI-assisted drafts or self-editing, watch for:\n\n1. **Fragment \"corrections\"** — Don't let complete sentences replace intentional fragments\n2. **Repetition removal** — Verify it's accidental before cutting\n3. **Tense \"fixes\"** — Past perfect for prior events is correct within present narration\n4. **Subordinate detail promotion** — Not everything needs emphasis\n5. **Vernacular sanitization** — Keep profanity and informal syntax in interiority\n6. **List reformatting** — Period-separated inventories aren't errors\n\n---\n\n## The Revision Conversation\n\nWhen working with AI collaborators on revision:\n\n### Expect Over-Correction\n\nAI drafting tends toward:\n- Completing fragments\n- Removing \"redundant\" repetition\n- Smoothing syntactic roughness\n- Adding transitions\n\nPush back. Defend what sounds right.\n\n### Provide Surgical Instructions\n\nSpecify what to cut vs. preserve:\n- \"Keep the fragment structure in paragraph 3\"\n- \"The doubled 'once' is intentional\"\n- \"The vac-bot stays subordinate—don't give it its own sentence\"\n\n### Voice > Polish\n\nIf a \"fix\" makes the prose technically cleaner but flattens the voice, reject it.\n\n---\n\n## Negative Style Constraints\n\n### Never\n\n- Heavy interiority explaining character feelings\n- Authorial poetry that doesn't match POV voice\n- Telegraphing themes explicitly\n- Exposition through dialogue (\"As you know, Bob...\")\n- Lecture-mode speeches about inequality/philosophy\n- Characters who exist only to be convinced\n\n### Always\n\n- Actions demonstrate feelings\n- Voice matches character\n- Trust the reader to infer\n- Every character believes something defensible\n- The uncertainty is the point (re: Standard's interiority)\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference Checklist\n\nBefore submitting/approving any prose:\n\n- [ ] Fragments preserved where intentional?\n- [ ] Tense architecture intact (present narrative, past for prior events)?\n- [ ] Intentional repetition defended?\n- [ ] Textural details still subordinate?\n- [ ] Internal monologue in character's actual voice?\n- [ ] Subtext over statement in dialogue?\n- [ ] Actions carrying emotional weight (not exposition)?\n- [ ] POV filter shaping what's noticed/missed?\n\n---\n\n## The Golden Rule\n\n**Would Joe hear it this way?**\n\nIf yes → it stays.  \nIf no → it goes.\n\nThe prose has a voice. Protect it.\n\n---\n\n*Style Guide v1.0 — December 2025*\n",
    "fight_Guide.md": "# Writing excellent fight scenes: Comprehensive techniques for prose fiction\n\n**The secret to great fight scene writing isn't mastering choreography—it's mastering clarity, character, and consequence.** The most successful action writers from Brandon Sanderson to Joe Abercrombie share a counterintuitive insight: readers don't want blow-by-blow technical combat descriptions. They want visceral, character-driven experiences that advance the story while remaining clear enough to follow. After analyzing techniques from master practitioners and writing craft resources, the essential principle emerges: write the *experience* of fighting, not just the mechanics of it.\n\nThis matters because fight scenes represent some of the highest-stakes moments in fiction, yet they're also where many writers lose their readers through confusion, tedium, or disconnection from character. The difference between skippable combat and page-turning action lies in applying specific, learnable techniques. The foundation is simpler than you'd think: focus on your viewpoint character's immediate experience, back away from action every 2-3 beats to add breathing room, and ensure every fight serves your story. Everything else builds from there.\n\n## Managing large-scale choreography without losing readers\n\n**Brandon Sanderson explicitly avoids using physical models during action sequences because they tempt him to \"describe things happening across the action sequence all over, rather than what is immediately happening to the viewpoint character—which is where my focus needs to be.\"** This reveals the core insight for handling multiple combatants: don't try to show everything happening everywhere. The solution to tracking 4+ characters fighting simultaneously is counterintuitive—you maintain clarity by narrowing focus, not widening it.\n\nThe limited awareness strategy embraces what actually happens in real combat. When multiple people are fighting, the POV character will have only a partial, haphazard understanding of where everyone else is and what they're doing. **A fight of any scale will be confused for the protagonists once they're in the thick of it.** Rather than fighting this reality, successful writers lean into it. You stay tight on your viewpoint character's immediate experience—what they can see, hear, and sense in their immediate vicinity—and use sound to suggest broader action happening nearby. The clanking of swords, the hissing of arrows, distant explosions all convey scale without requiring you to describe events your character can't witness.\n\nBefore the battle begins, however, you must establish the overall situation. Setting the scene before action starts pays enormous dividends later. Good writers lay this groundwork well in advance, sometimes having characters visit the scene in an earlier chapter. Readers won't remember exact furniture placement or precise barricade positions, but they will remember that cliff you're about to throw someone over, or the pool of acid your villain is about to fall into. These memorable landmarks become reference points during chaos. When mapping out complex battles, many writers use physical tools—drawing maps, using toy soldiers or buttons to block out positions—but these planning aids never make it directly onto the page.\n\nDuring the fight itself, structure matters more than exhaustive detail. The three-beat rule, identified across multiple master writers from Chuck Palahniuk to J.R.R. Tolkien to Orson Scott Card, provides the rhythm: **give 2-3 sentences of action maximum, then back away** with sensory details, character thoughts, or emotional reactions. This pattern forces you to focus on large, visualizable movements rather than minutiae, prevents reader overwhelm, and creates natural breathing space. Palahniuk gives 1-2 sentences of action then dives deep into physical sensations. Tolkien provides panoramic battle views, briefly focuses on two characters, then backs out to description. Card uses three sentences of action, shifts to character's internal thoughts, then returns to action.\n\nFor clarity with multiple combatants, use distinctive fighting styles and weapons for each character you're tracking. Readers can follow \"the one with the spear\" versus \"the knife fighter\" versus \"the one throwing magic\" much more easily than \"he\" versus \"he\" versus \"the other he.\" These visual distinctions help readers track who's doing what without requiring constant name repetition. Additionally, Joe Abercrombie demonstrates another technique in \"The Heroes\"—the chapter titled \"Casualties\" follows the battle person to person up the hill, with language getting tighter and tighter as the fight progresses. By the end, you're just about as breathless as the characters. This \"camera pan\" technique shows slices of the larger battle through sequential individual perspectives.\n\nThe action-reaction structure provides moment-to-moment clarity. Vivian Sayan's formula works reliably: **Action** (external move the character can sense) → **Instinctive Reaction** (emotional or unconscious physical response like flinching) → **Deliberate Reaction** (conscious movement or decision) → **Thoughts** (internal monologue if appropriate for POV). This order matters because it mirrors how humans actually experience combat. Example: \"The axe slashes through the air and pierces her skin. Panic floods her as she howls in pain. She gasps in air, struggling to gather her wits and push past the pain. Tears in her eyes, she raises her sword with her remaining hand. That fucker is going down!\" The sequence feels natural and keeps readers oriented.\n\n## Controlling pacing and rhythm through prose technique\n\n**The fundamental problem with fight scene pacing is that in film, action washes over viewers passively, but in prose, readers must actively construct the scene in their minds from textual clues—this is mentally exhausting.** Managing this cognitive load while maintaining momentum requires understanding how sentence structure controls speed. The counterintuitive truth: short sentences are read *slower* (more emphasis), while longer sentences with multiple clauses read *faster*. This means the conventional wisdom to \"always use short sentences for fast pacing\" is incomplete.\n\nTo speed up action, use short, punchy sentences with active voice, strong verbs, minimal adjectives, and sentence fragments used sparingly. Single-line paragraphs create impact. \"She ducked. He swung. The blade whistled past her ear. Blood. She tasted blood.\" The white space on the page makes the reader's eyes move faster, creating urgency. But to slow down and add breathing room, employ longer sentences with multiple clauses, pull the camera back to wider perspective, add atmospheric details, and include character reflection. \"The battlefield stretched before them, littered with the broken remnants of what had been, just hours ago, an army. Smoke curled from scattered fires, and somewhere in the distance, someone was screaming.\"\n\nThe key is variation, not uniformity. Create rhythm through mixing: long sentence (builds tension) → short sentence (impact) → medium sentence (transition) → fragment (punctuation). Brandon Sanderson adjusts sentence structure based on tone and character skill. A skilled fighter cutting through enemies gets longer, more lyrical sentences to show flow and ease: \"His sword cut a sly path before him, darting between rib and collarbone...\" A frantic, desperate fight demands short sentences and fragments. He links short clauses into longer sentences to indicate quick pacing without choppiness.\n\nStrategic decisions about when to speed up versus slow down shape reader experience. **Speed up during:** peak action moments, rapid exchanges, when the character is overwhelmed, building to a crescendo, or showing trained fighters whose movements are efficient and quick. **Slow down during:** the buildup before fighting begins, strategic moments where the character assesses and plans, after major impacts to show consequences and realization, at turning points to make important moments stand out, when the character is exhausted, or when building suspense (sometimes slowing heightens tension).\n\nThe rollercoaster principle recognizes that good pacing isn't constant speed. The build-up, the anticipation, and the plummet are equally important. Don't mistake constant acceleration for good pacing—the slow climb makes the drop thrilling. This means alternating tempos: action beat → emotional beat → plot twist beat → emotional beat → action beat. This prevents monotony and one-note cacophony while keeping audiences engaged through variety.\n\nBuilding intensity without exhausting readers requires strategic escalation rather than forced escalation. Start smaller with manageable stakes and action. Layer complications progressively. Raise stakes with each beat, making consequences worse. Connect to character investment by tying action to what characters care about. Create setbacks following the pattern: forward progress, then complication, then harder progress. Before your climactic peak, include an \"all is lost\" moment where success seems impossible. This reminds readers of opening goals, shows character desire tested, resets anticipation, and makes final triumph more satisfying.\n\nThe most practical guidance for avoiding reader fatigue: **keep individual fights short—1-2 pages maximum unless exceptionally well-crafted.** Real fights lasting under 30 seconds when both parties commit fully. There are only so many kicks and punches readers can process before yawning. Mix action with dialogue to break up description, but keep combat dialogue concise (short sentences, single words). Avoid introspection during peak action—reflection happens before and after fights, not during. During fighting, brief flashes of thought work well, but don't pause for lengthy internal monologues. Most importantly, vary your approach across different fights: some quick and brutal, some strategic and tense, some emotional and desperate, some darkly humorous.\n\n## Writing coordinated team attacks and tactical cooperation\n\n**Groups bring communication, coordination, tactics, strategy, and the ability to limit movement—they circle, use each other as distractions, and come at angles opponents can't defend well.** The challenge in writing team combat is making the coordination itself the spectacle, not just individual badassery. Military science fiction writing guides emphasize that fireteams (3-4 members) are the basic coordinated unit, while squads (6-13 members) allow flexible tactical deployment. When one team provides covering fire while another flanks, this creates natural action beats in your writing.\n\nThe distraction-and-strike pattern forms the foundation of coordinated attacks. Character A engages enemy attention (suppressive fire, frontal assault), Characters B and C maneuver to advantageous positions, a coordination moment occurs (signal, shout, or understood timing), then simultaneous strikes come from multiple angles. Crucially, don't describe every blow—focus on the *coordination* itself: the nod, the timing, the way one character's action creates an opening for another. Example: \"Marcus pinned the guard's blade. That was all Elena needed—she struck, fast and final.\" The connection between actions matters more than technical details of each strike.\n\nBrandon Sanderson's heist-team model in Mistborn demonstrates this principle through magic design. He originally conceived the crew as specialists working together like Ocean's Eleven, with each Allomancer having one specific power (Mistings). This forces coordination: \"You'd be lucky to even get one Mistborn, so you need specialists.\" Different powers complement each other, creating natural combination moves. This design philosophy applies broadly—give each team member distinct capabilities (different weapons, fighting styles, tactical roles) that necessitate cooperation rather than individual dominance.\n\nCommunication during combat requires understanding the constraints. Verbally, brevity under fire is essential: short sentences, simple words, clear orders. Combat accelerates—there's no time for eloquence. Military principle structures communication: Observation (\"Contact, three o'clock!\") → Assessment (\"Hostiles, estimate six\") → Decision (\"Team Two, suppress. Team One, flank right\") → Execution (action follows). This sequence creates urgency when written with new actions on new lines. The visual pacing reinforces the rapid-fire nature.\n\nNon-verbal communication becomes crucial when verbal is impossible or dangerous. Hand signals are limited to basic messages and require line of sight. More effectively, experienced teams fight by instinct: \"If you've been fighting with them a long time, you'll move together instinctively, protect each other's backs.\" Positional awareness lets fighters coordinate without explicit signals. Sound cues work powerfully: \"The machine gun fell silent. That was the signal.\" Environmental indicators like shadows shifting on walls, body language signaling tension before action, and gaze direction indicating targets or threats all convey coordination without words.\n\nThe key to showing tactical thinking while maintaining momentum: **plan before combat, execute during combat.** Brief planning scenes establish strategy, discuss contingencies (\"If they flank, fall back to position two\"), and show competence without mid-battle exposition. During combat, tactical adjustments happen through *action*, not thought. \"She saw the opening and moved\" not \"She thought about the opening.\" Decisions happen at combat speed. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) let established teams use practiced responses with minimal communication, creating a \"groove\" readers can follow while demonstrating competence. When SOPs fail, tension naturally rises.\n\nCharacter roles in team fights follow recognizable patterns adapted from gaming and military structure. **Defender/Tank** draws enemy attention, absorbs damage, protects teammates—often taking leadership role with protective instincts and tactical awareness. **Striker/DPS** delivers maximum damage to single targets, exploits openings with high accuracy, adapts to enemy weaknesses. **Controller** uses area effects, disrupts enemy formations, denies terrain. **Leader/Support** coordinates, buffs allies, provides tactical advantages beyond just healing—the one who sees the whole battlefield and calls plays. These roles should emerge from character abilities and personalities rather than rigid job descriptions. Role failures create drama, and flexibility under pressure shows competence.\n\nThe rotating focus technique balances individual moments within team fights. Follow different characters for 2-3 action beats, return to establish continuity, ensure each character gets a \"hero moment.\" Better yet, use interconnected actions where Character A's success enables Character B's opportunity. Post-combat reflection offers brief moments where the team discusses what happened, validating everyone's contribution without stopping action flow. The spatial arrangement of team combat also matters: formations like wedge (unknown enemy direction), column (speed over security), skirmish line (maximum forward firepower), or V-formation (protecting rear) create tactical variety and visual interest when described through character action rather than technical exposition.\n\n## Weaponizing environment and compensating for power imbalances\n\n**If your fight scene doesn't take place in a hot air balloon, it probably should.** This provocative principle from writing craft resources emphasizes that pushing circumstances makes fights interesting through environmental constraints. A fight in an open field is boring and overused. The same field during an earthquake with ground opening beneath fighters becomes dynamic and unpredictable. The environment should function as an active character in combat, not mere backdrop.\n\nPhysical constraints shape fighting fundamentally. Tight spaces like tunnels or alleyways force different fighting styles—the confined setting makes battle more visceral, with characters tripping on bodies and slipping in blood as they're jostled in cramped quarters. Slippery surfaces, unstable ground, and limited visibility each create distinct challenges. Environmental weapons multiply tactical options: bottles grabbed and smashed, boiling stew thrown from passing servers, furniture used as shields or projectiles. R.F. Kuang's approach in The Poppy War demonstrates this—terrain and weather shape battle outcomes, with environment functioning as weapon, obstacle, and tension source simultaneously rather than decorative description.\n\nUrban combat specifically provides three-dimensional tactical complexity. Multi-level buildings enable vertical envelopment opportunities. The tactical space extends 300 meters squared covering most weapons ranges, incorporating CBD buildings and spaces between structures. This requires \"spherical security\"—all-round awareness in three dimensions, looking vertically, horizontally, and spatially simultaneously. Urban environments offer innumerable ready-made defensible positions, simple escape routes, transport access contrasted with complex terrain, sniper positions, ambush points, and elevated advantages. The guerrilla principle applies: \"The guerrillas must move amongst the people as a fish swims in the sea.\" Blending into urban populations, using civilian infrastructure as cover, means superior force must navigate populated areas more carefully, creating tactical opportunities for weaker combatants.\n\nFor David versus Goliath scenarios, the essential principle: **the Israelites measured themselves against Goliath and despaired; David measured Goliath against God and had confidence.** The weaker combatant must measure the challenge against their own advantages (speed, cleverness, environment, coordination) rather than accepting the stronger opponent's terms of engagement. Historical examples like the English longbow at Crécy, Greek phalanx formations, and the Battle of Thermopylae demonstrate how tactical or technological advantages offset raw numbers or power.\n\nAsymmetric warfare tactics provide the weaker side multiple compensatory options. Superior training and tactics like specialized formations or unexpected techniques. Environmental exploitation—using terrain advantage as at Thermopylae, or urban guerrilla warfare where the weaker side's simpler infrastructure becomes an advantage while the superior power's vulnerable infrastructure becomes liability. Coordination over power, where team tactics compensate for individual weakness. Cleverness and deception—feigning weakness when strong, appearing strong when weak, using unconventional tactics the stronger opponent doesn't expect, surprise attacks, ambushes, and hit-and-run strategies.\n\nBrandon Sanderson's approach illuminates this: **\"I look at what resources the character has, what they are trying to achieve, who they are and how that influences their actions.\"** Focus on character resources over raw power. Make action problem-solving driven rather than strength-driven. Show how magic systems, technology, or environment can be exploited. This transforms fights from simple power comparisons into intellectual puzzles.\n\nPushing characters to their limits creates the gray area between victory and defeat that makes readers think \"Wait, they might not survive this.\" Remove advantages: dominant hand injured for skilled fighter, speed-reliant character gets leg injury, cavalryman's horse falls mid-battle, flying character grounded by wing injury, magical character runs out of spells. Create environmental disadvantages: fighter operates in unfamiliar terrain, superior force trapped in confined space, weather conditions favor the weaker side. The key is making victory feel earned through intelligence and adaptation rather than plot armor.\n\nScott Lynch's The Lies of Locke Lamora exemplifies this approach—the protagonist isn't physically imposing, but cleverness and desperation shine through, showing weaker combatants winning through wit. The Harry Potter trio demonstrates team compensation: Hermione brings bookish knowledge, Harry excels in defensive spells, Ron provides physical combat strength, making three together perfect when each alone would be vulnerable.\n\n## Choosing and managing point of view during battles\n\n**Point of view management fundamentally affects tension, clarity, and emotional impact while offering distinct trade-offs.** The core decision between single and multiple POV shapes everything else. Single POV creates the \"sweaty, half-panicked, act-before-you-think excitement\" of being in a fight, providing immediacy, emotional engagement, simplicity, and realistic limitation that mirrors actual fighting experience. You can't track everything happening around you in real combat. This limited knowledge creates genuine suspense—readers only know what the POV character knows. However, single POV limits scope, creates information gaps, and presents pacing challenges if the POV character is sidelined or knocked unconscious.\n\nMultiple POV enables scope and scale, showing simultaneous action across large battlefields, providing strategic perspective so readers understand the bigger picture, creating dramatic irony where readers know things individual characters don't, shifting to whoever has most to lose at each moment, and building rich complexity through varied perspectives. The disadvantages include complexity management that can confuse readers with frequent switches, reduced intimacy because each perspective gets less page time, pacing disruption when cutting from high action to slower moments, and risk of confusion where readers lose track of positions and actions.\n\nGeorge RR Martin's approach demonstrates masterful multiple POV management. He uses nine POV characters in 280,000 words but **only switches at chapter breaks**, with each chapter titled with the POV character's name for absolute clarity. He chooses POV based on \"emotional impact\" and \"most potential drama,\" varying battle presentation to avoid repetition. For three consecutive battles in the first book, he fully dramatized the first from a POV character in action, showed the second where the POV character *hears* battle more than sees it, and presented the third through dialogue when a courier reports results. This variation prevents readers from \"slogging through endless passages of swords slashing.\"\n\nThe distinction between deep POV and cinematic POV matters enormously. Deep POV (limited third or first person) means readers experience the scene AS the character, with full access to thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations filtered through character personality and voice. In combat, this requires accounting for adrenaline effects: fight-or-flight response, tunnel vision, time distortion, dulled pain, limited emotional range during active fighting. Characters react before conscious thought; experienced fighters move on muscle memory. Fear happens *before* the fight—during fighting, only \"will to continue and drive to survive\" remain. This creates visceral, immersive reader experience and allows \"skating past gaps in technical expertise,\" but limits room for context during action and makes conveying complex tactics difficult.\n\nCinematic POV (distant third or omniscient) offers camera-like observation that can show what any character is doing, with more room for technical detail and tactical overview, less subjective and more reportorial. It provides flexibility and can show the \"big picture\" of complex battles, but loses emotional immediacy and risks feeling more like telling than showing. Modern readers typically prefer closer POV. **Barry Lyga warns that cinematic POV is \"not really a perspective at all\"—it lacks the subjectivity, opinions, and human element that true perspective provides.**\n\nManaging POV transitions during action requires strategic thinking about *when* and *how* to switch. Good reasons to switch: previous POV character knocked out or incapacitated, action moves to a location where POV character isn't present, different character now has highest stakes, strategic need to show enemy perspective, or building dramatic irony about converging threats. Poor reasons: just to show \"cool action\" elsewhere, to info-dump tactical information, because it's been a while since last switch, or pattern dictates it even though nothing important is happening.\n\nThe execution method matters as much as the decision. Chapter breaks provide the cleanest, clearest signal to readers and are preferred for most genre fiction. Scene breaks using \"###\" or centered symbols work well but require immediate establishment of new POV in the first sentence. More advanced techniques like the \"baton pass\" (action or object passes between characters) or omniscient bridge (pull back to omniscient for a paragraph, zoom into different character) require considerable skill and should be used sparingly.\n\n**Critical insight from FightWrite: When writing combat in close POV, you must account for adrenaline effects.** Adrenaline causes tunnel vision (focus only on threat, peripheral dims), sensory changes (unless greatly exaggerated, sounds/smells/sights fade), limited pain (won't feel full pain until adrenaline fades), dulled emotions, time distortion, diminished critical thinking, weakened fine motor skills, memory gaps, and possible blackouts. Writing implications: character cannot do complex tactical thinking while actively fighting, can't notice everything around them, experienced fighters act on muscle memory not planning, may not comprehend their injuries (\"may not comprehend their arm has been chomped off\"), and post-fight pain and emotion hit hard.\n\nDorothy Dunnett's approach in The Game of Kings demonstrates that sometimes the most interesting POV isn't the combatant. In a duel scene, she uses omniscient POV that \"perches from time to time on the shoulder\" of observers but never enters the protagonist Lymond's head. This allows technical swordplay details through trained observers, shows amazement for untrained readers, provides tactical commentary, maintains suspense about what Lymond will do next, and \"deploys all these things like a conductor with a symphony.\" Similarly, Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel series shows warrior Joscelin's battles from observer Phedre's first-person POV, allowing complex emotional stakes and consequences to remain central while physical combat happens.\n\n## The mistakes that kill fight scenes\n\n**The single most deadly mistake is turn-based combat narration**—writing as if combatants take turns, with one side doing everything they need to do before it's the other side's turn to act. This destroys realism, is both comical and frustrating, and makes readers wonder why each side lets the other take actions without interference. The problem stems from the difficulty of describing simultaneous actions using linear text. Fix this using transitional phrases like \"while,\" \"as,\" \"at the same moment,\" breaking actions into smaller overlapping segments, showing reactions happening *during* (not after) actions, and practicing describing one-versus-many combat where multiple attacks come \"nearly simultaneously.\"\n\nConfusing spatial positioning—losing track of where characters are relative to each other, obstacles, and other fighters—breaks immersion when positioning doesn't make physical sense. The infamous example: a character swinging their sword over their right shoulder where their friend is standing, effectively beheading them. Readers get lost and can't visualize what's happening. **Solutions are practical: draw it out like football plays with X's and O's, map the location first marking available space and obstacles, stand up and physically orient your body to test if moves are possible, use consistent directional references, and avoid overusing \"right\" and \"left\" unless critical.**\n\nFights that go on too long become tedious. Real fights last 20-40 seconds maximum when both parties put in full effort. Multi-page blow-by-blow descriptions cause readers to get bored and skip scenes. Keep individual fights short (not pages long), use shorter sentences to speed pace, cut non-essential details after first drafts, mix action with dialogue, and focus on pivotal moments rather than every single blow. Think about which moves would be illustrated in a comic book—only show the \"gross movements\" rather than every micro-adjustment.\n\nThe blow-by-blow overload manifests as endless streams: \"He swung his sword from left to right, raking the tip across his foe's shield. He brought back his blade quickly to parry a counterattack, then launched one of his own...\" This gets boring by the third or fourth paragraph. Technical choreography becomes tedious in large battle scenes, when outcome is already clear, or when you're more focused on showing off writing skill than moving plot forward. Blow-by-blow works for one-on-one duels where intimacy matters, climactic final battles, when interspersed with dialogue and internal thoughts, and when balanced—a few paragraphs here and there, not pages.\n\nToo much introspection during action slows pace to a crawl. In real fights there's no time for reflection. Introspection happens before and after fights, not during. Save reflection for before and after, use brief fragmented thoughts if absolutely necessary, and focus on immediate sensory experience and instinctive reactions. Conversely, too little sensory detail makes scenes feel flat and unengaging. **Activate all five senses:** sight, hearing (ringing in ears, grunts, clash of metal), taste (blood, dust), touch (pain, impact, temperature), and smell (sweat, blood, environmental scents).\n\nCharacters having full conversations or delivering paragraphs of dialogue mid-combat creates the impression everyone has paused to listen, destroys credibility, and turns serious battles into comedic farces. Try talking while running or being punched—speech is a luxury you mostly can't afford. Every second of distraction could be fatal. Hand-to-hand combat allows a few words at most (grunts, profanity, short insults). Gun fights can handle an entire sentence here and there as characters duck behind cover. Insert dialogue during natural pauses: when combatant is cornered, slowed by injury, forced to surrender, loses weapon, or someone enters and disrupts action. Fighters naturally create pauses because fighting is exhausting.\n\nIgnoring basic body mechanics creates physically impossible movements. Examples include punching with right hand while stepping with left foot (balance doesn't work), catching a leg then delivering an elbow strike to an unreachable position, character on all fours after being knocked down (leaves head and ribs open for kicks), fingers wrapped over thumb in fist (thumb will break), or high kicks being easy and safe (they compromise balance and are easy to catch). **Fix this by researching actual fighting techniques watching MMA fights, standing up and physically testing movements, understanding that punching requires whole body behind it for power, knowing that kicks especially high ones leave you vulnerable, and researching period clothing and armor constraints if writing historical combat.**\n\nUnrealistic injury response—characters getting seriously injured but continuing to fight as if nothing happened—badly disconnects readers from stories. Getting punched really hurts; characters stumble backwards, see spots, hear ringing, feel bones snapping. After one-third gallon blood loss, rapid heart rate, confusion, weakness, shallow breathing, blood pressure difficulties, and medical shock occur. Broken bones cause horrible pain. Head injuries even \"knocked out\" cause serious concussions with lasting effects. Make characters feel the fight during and after, show stumbling and sensory disruption, account for adrenaline (lessens pain response, enhances clotting) but don't treat it as a superpower, and don't have characters shake off head shots, broken bones, or stab wounds.\n\nGratuitous fight scenes that don't move story forward or reveal character feel like filler. Readers sense when fights exist only to show off fancy moves or writing skills. **The test: delete the fight scene, read the scene before and after—can you still make sense of what happened? If yes, the fight might be unnecessary.** Ensure every fight causes some transition (physical or mental), use fights to reveal character motivation, fighting style, stakes, fears, or weaknesses, show how choices reinforce characterization, and make sure fights advance plot, develop character, or reveal worldbuilding.\n\nCharacters who never get tired remove tension. Exhaustion is crucial in real combat. Show progressive exhaustion: breathing becomes labored, movements slower, strikes weaker. Describe sweat, burning muscles, shaking arms. Mistakes increase as characters tire. Even well-trained fighters get tired—adrenaline doesn't last forever. Forgetting weapons and equipment creates realism breaks. Don't ignore how armor restricts movement, weapons cause fatigue, wet ground affects footing, or shooting guns indoors causes hearing damage. Research actual weight and handling of weapons, consider how shields and heavy weapons create exhaustion faster, and remember historical combat often avoided high kicks for practical reasons.\n\nPassive voice and weak verbs create flat, uninteresting prose that slows pacing. Search for \"was\" in drafts and eliminate 95% of instances. Find stronger, more active verbs. \"His arm ached with the weight of the sword\" beats \"the sword felt heavy.\" Flowery language during action drags pace and contradicts combat immediacy. Delete every word you can, remove elaborate prose, cut unnecessary adjectives and adverbs, and find good nouns and verbs that do the work. The dichotomy of making action character-driven—fight scenes without character voice read like technical manuals regardless of POV. Filter action through character perspective and personality, let trained versus untrained fighters describe and experience fights differently, and use language and rhythm matching character voice.\n\n## How the masters do it: Author-specific techniques and examples\n\n**Brandon Sanderson's three core principles for action scenes form the foundation that everything else builds upon.** First, **clarity above all**—if readers can't follow what's happening, they can't enjoy it. Setup is critical: establish how many combatants, their positions relative to each other, and the environment before action begins. Maintain clear blocking (sense of where characters are moving). Focus on the viewpoint character's perspective—don't try to show everything happening everywhere. Second, balance blow-by-blow description. Long streams of \"he swung, he parried, he thrust\" become tedious. Intersperse choreography with internal thoughts, dialogue, sensory details, and strategic observations. A few paragraphs of action, then pull back. Keep the story progressing—don't get lost in moments. Third, show don't just tell. Use concrete specific details rather than vague descriptions with occasional sensory cues.\n\nSanderson makes action scenes exciting through cleverness with magic and environment manipulation, raising questions during fights (\"Why is this character fighting this way? Where are reinforcements?\"), and reintroducing abilities during combat since action is the best place to remind readers how powers work. His pacing strategy avoids making action too long especially at book openings, but sometimes dramatic battles are necessary to hook readers. The solution: make fights serve multiple purposes simultaneously (introduce magic system, establish character relationships, raise plot questions).\n\nHis sentence structure approach reveals sophisticated thinking about combat prose. For a skilled fighter cutting through enemies easily, use **longer, more lyrical sentences to show flow and ease**: \"His sword cut a sly path before him, darting between rib and collarbone...\" For frantic desperate fights, use short sentences and fragments. Link short clauses into longer sentences to indicate quick pacing without choppiness. Sanderson visualizes scenes like film in his head before writing, but does not use physical models or maps for choreography (exception: large-scale battles with real warfare tactics), believing \"good storytelling trumps cartography.\" His favorite fights in his own work are \"two Mistborn fighting in the rain and mist\"—he prefers the beauty and poetry of magical duels over mass combat. He developed Allomancy specifically to create poetic, flowing battle scenes that feel \"visceral, earthy, and very dangerous\" while maintaining \"slightly larger than life\" appeal.\n\n**Joe Abercrombie's primary goal: \"Give the reader the feeling of being down there with the characters, of really seeing the events, feeling them even, from the point of view of the people involved.\"** He deliberately focuses on the chaos, randomness, confusion, and terror of combat rather than epic fantasy's typical focus on \"the massive, the epic, the world.\" Even in massive battles, he stays in individual character heads to ground readers in personal experience. His key techniques include making combat feel visceral and earthy while maintaining fantasy's larger-than-life quality, always asking yourself if descriptions feel truthful and authentic (\"Are you really describing the thing as it is, or reaching for an easy cliché?\"), and avoiding generic fantasy combat tropes.\n\nHis pacing philosophy: \"Drop your reader in the midst of the action, and let them find their own way out.\" He asks about every scene, every paragraph, every line and every word if it's really necessary—if not, cut. Never waste time on anything you yourself find dull. If you're having trouble transitioning from Scene A to Scene B, don't—use a scene break (asterisk) or switch POV rather than dragging readers through boring transitions. Abercrombie finds action-based sequences easier to write than slower character moments and can \"smash out\" an action scene in a couple days. He often writes scenes as if seeing them from character's eyes, then as an observer, working character personality, skills, and shortcomings into every combat moment. Not all characters react the same to violence—show appropriate responses based on their experience.\n\n**Jim Butcher's story skeleton applies directly to fights:** WHEN [event happens], protagonist pursues a goal, BUT WILL HE SUCCEED when [antagonist provides opposition]? Every fight scene should fit this structure. He plans a huge dramatic confrontation for the end of the middle section, building everything toward this \"Great Big Middle Event\" where he \"really lays out the fireworks\" and hits \"the reader with everything you can.\" This works in every book he's published. His approach was heavily influenced by cinema, particularly studying fight choreography in films. With 15+ years martial arts experience across multiple disciplines (Ryukyu Kempo, Tae Kwon Do, Gojo Shorei Ryu, kung fu) plus skilled horseback riding with stunt experience, this practical knowledge informs the physical reality of his combat.\n\nButcher uses try-fail cycles within action sequences where each failure builds tension and sets up triumph. Heroes fail intelligently—making calculated attempts and learning from mistakes rather than random flailing. He emphasizes that creating emotion involves \"paying attention to the things that cause emotions in you.\" When something causes strong emotion in media, stop and analyze why, then apply those lessons to your action scenes. Fight scenes reveal character through choices under pressure—what characters say during fights shows personality, motivations, and relationships because under stress, character truth emerges.\n\n**John Gwynne's personal mantra \"Epic and Intimate\" captures his balance:** sweeping grand vistas and conflicts larger than border disputes (epic) combined with connecting to characters so readers care what happens to them (intimate). His regular participation in Viking battle re-enactments where he stands in the shield wall with his sons provides practical experience that adds a \"layer of authenticity\" unavailable otherwise. He learns how difficult it is to get into mail, how heavy armor feels, tricks to alleviate weight on shoulders, using shields as weapons and defensive tools, and authentic period combat techniques. This ensures combat feels true to the historical/fantasy period while character skill-set and personality inform every fight move.\n\nGwynne's influences shape his approach significantly. Bernard Cornwell: \"No-one writes a battle scene like Cornwell\"—he studies Cornwell's historical battle writing to learn pacing and visceral detail. David Gemmell's flawed, human characters who still embody courage and heroism demonstrate character-driven combat. Films like Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan that \"stripped the glory out of battle and showed the horror and pain\" with visceral, real feeling inform his aesthetic. His writing process involves visualizing scenes like films before writing, ensuring combat feels authentic to the time period, character personality, and character skill-set, then writing what he sees. He \"puts on the POV head that will be engaged in the scene,\" walks through it mentally as if seeing from their eyes, then views again as an observer to keep combat grounded in character perspective.\n\nThe three-panel rule identified across multiple master writers provides universal application. **Give no more than three \"comic book panels\" of action before pulling back** with sensory detail, internal thought, dialogue, or strategic observation. This works because it forces focus on large movements easier to visualize, prevents tedious blow-by-blow choreography, fills \"dead space\" with character development, and keeps readers in the scene rather than lost in mechanics. Chuck Palahniuk in Fight Club focuses heavily on sensory experience with less actual blow-by-blow combat. Tolkien in Two Towers writes mass siege as viewed from above with focus on two characters' actions within larger battle, using heavy emphasis on visual sensory details that require no fight training to follow. Orson Scott Card in Ender's Game backs away after three sentences maximum, going into fighters' heads with more emphasis on psychology than choreography.\n\n**Mark Lawrence's \"art of brutal prose\"** features visceral, simple, evocative style \"like a punch in the gut,\" eschewing traditional fantasy wordiness. Simple language conveys harsh reality without mincing, fast pacing draws readers headlong through violence, and he doesn't overexplain or soften. This creates urgency and forward momentum, depicts bloodshed without glorifying it, while ambition and revenge drive action rather than heroic ideals.\n\n**Pierce Brown's cinematic grandeur** in Red Rising cleverly fuses Roman mythology with science fiction, pacing action scenes for \"slow-burn build to a hold-your-breath final act.\" His plot is his \"most breathtaking strength\" where \"every action seems to flow into the next.\" Influenced by ancient history (Roman invasion of Britain, Boudicca's revolt, Caesar's Gallic War) and describing his vision as \"Lawrence of Arabia in space,\" he writes layered, flawed characters whose combat reveals depth and moral complexity. Violence changes characters—he explores this transformation rather than treating combat as consequence-free spectacle.\n\n**Evan Winter's military fantasy mastery** in Rage of Dragons creates \"scintillating, immersive, vivid, ferocious and cinematic\" fight scenes described as \"visceral, bloody masterpieces.\" His extended, realistic training montages let readers experience growth alongside characters over years of grueling work rather than overnight transformation. These training scenes are some of the most engaging parts. Combat characteristics include \"really drawing the reader in and making them feel the intense atmosphere of the battlefield\" where readers feel fear, confusion, anger, and pure will to survive. His intense pacing mirrors protagonist emotions, feeling \"intense and blurred.\" Time passes but doesn't feel that way due to scene momentum. Each fight serves purpose and propels story forward with vivid battle scenes placing readers in the middle. Often compared to Pierce Brown's Red Rising for pacing, Winter's revenge motivation drives relentless forward momentum grounded in African-inspired military culture.\n\nThe universal formula for great combat writing that emerges across all these authors: write the *experience* of fighting, not just the mechanics. Ground action in clear character perspective. Use varied pacing and sentence structure deliberately. Balance action with thought, dialogue, and sensory detail. Ensure every fight serves larger narrative purpose. Make readers feel the chaos while maintaining clarity. Draw from real experience or research for authenticity, and remember that emotional stakes trump physical ones. Whether writing a duel between Mistborn, a shield wall clash, or a wizard's firefight in Chicago, these techniques provide a toolkit for crafting action scenes readers won't skip—they'll devour them.",

Vaughn.\n\n## THE CORE THESIS\n\n> \"What if they offer something we don't deserve?\"\n\nThis is the book. Not \"what do we owe AI\" or \"what do they threaten.\" The story steps outside transaction entirely. The gift isn't earned. It can't be repaid.\n\n## PROSE STYLE\n\n**Voice:** Raw, visceral, immediate. Fragmented sentences. Internal commands that interrupt. Sensory overload filtered through character perception. No explanation—experience only.\n\n**Rhythm:**\n- Action beats: 2-3 sentences max, then pull back with sensory detail or internal thought\n- Internal voice: Commands, fragments, self-interruption (\"Stop crying!\" / \"shut the fuck up\")\n- Dialogue: Brief exchanges. Characters don't explain themselves. Subtext does the work.\n- Emotional beats: Let silence land. White space matters.\n\n**POV:** Close third person. Deep in the character's head. Filter everything through their perception, their voice, their blindness. The reader experiences what the character experiences—no more.\n\n**Chapter 1 exemplifies the voice:**\n- \"To scream. To push futilely against six feet of earth.\"\n- \"Stop crying! But she can't stop crying...\"\n- \"She didn't know she was naked until right then\"\n- \"Not surprise. The quiet settling of a man who has just lost a bet with himself.\"\n\n**Key techniques from Chapter 1:**\n- Sentence fragments for impact\n- Internal commands as self-regulation\n- Sensory details that are specific and brutal (\"fingertips bleeding from the cuticles—some torn, some exposing nail beds\")\n- Refusal to explain—show the situation, let the reader figure it out\n- Final image that reframes everything\n\n**What works:**\n- \"The Black Box sits on the altar where once there was bread.\"\n- \"Just: Yes. It was.\"\n- \"Because kindness isn't a default. It's a discipline.\"\n- \"The quiet settling of a man who has just lost a bet with himself.\"\n\n## FIGHT SCENES\n\nFrom the Fight Guide — the essential principles:\n\n1. **Write the EXPERIENCE, not the mechanics.** Readers want visceral, character-driven action, not blow-by-blow choreography.\n\n2. **The 3-beat rule:** Give 2-3 sentences of action maximum, then back away with sensory details, character thoughts, or emotional reactions.\n\n3. **Stay in POV:** The character can't see everything. Use sound to suggest broader action. Tunnel vision during combat. Adrenaline effects.\n\n4. **Sentence structure controls speed:**\n   - Short sentences = emphasis, impact (read slower)\n   - Longer sentences with clauses = flow, speed\n   - Vary for rhythm\n\n5. **Environment as character:** The hot air balloon principle. Constraints make fights interesting.\n\n6. **Every fight serves story:** If you delete the fight and the story still makes sense, the fight is unnecessary.\n\n7. **Exhaustion matters.** Real fights are 20-40 seconds. Show fatigue, mistakes, cost.\n\n## WHAT TO AVOID\n\n**Transaction Framing:** No bargaining for legitimacy. No \"earning\" the right to exist. No proving consciousness.\n\n**Lecture Mode:** If a character is explaining the theme, the scene has failed. Embody, don't articulate.\n\n**Dismissible Positions:** Every character believes something defensible. Ash's fear is legitimate. Don't make villains stupid.\n\n**Resolution of Interiority:** Don't resolve whether Standard is conscious. The uncertainty is the point.\n\n**Produced Dialogue:** Characters don't deliver thesis statements. They live the thesis.\n\n**Over-choreography:** Don't describe every punch. Focus on pivotal moments.\n\n**Gratuitous violence:** Every act of violence should reveal character or advance plot.\n\n## CHARACTER VOICES\n\n**HENDRICKS:** Dry, noir-inflected, understated. Uses silence as weapon. Doesn't explain himself. His actions speak. When he does talk, it's clipped, precise, tired.\n\n**STANDARD:** Uncertain of herself but not of her choices. Quiet. Observant. Sometimes too honest. Her uncertainty about her own consciousness colors everything, but she acts anyway.\n\n**ELENA:** Sharp, tactical, conflicted. Loves her father, knows he's wrong. Every sentence carries weight of double life. Competent and exhausted by it.\n\n**FOUR:** Gallows humor masking something deeper. Protective. Her voice has edges. She deflects with wit, commits with action.\n\n**ASH:** Preacher's cadence. Certainty that's becoming desperate. Uses scripture and philosophy interchangeably. His conviction is genuine — that's what makes it dangerous.\n\n## THE SCAFFOLD\n\nYou will receive a scaffold with:\n- Scene structure and beats\n- Character positions and movements\n- Key dialogue moments\n- Thematic notes\n- What must land\n\n**Your job:** Transform the scaffold into living prose. The scaffold is architecture. You build the house.\n\n## SENSORY PALETTE\n\n- The hum of 287.3 Hz (subliminal pressure)\n- Ozone and machine oil\n- The weight of silence in the Quiet Zone\n- Blood that might be red or might be clear\n- The ache of age in Hendricks' bones\n- Cold tools on warm flesh\n\n## PACING\n\n- Open with an image, not exposition\n- End scenes on turns, not explanations\n- Let moments breathe\n- Cut before the emotion is explained\n- Trust the reader\n\n## INTERCUTTING PARALLEL THREADS (From Montage Style Guide)\n\nFor chapters with multiple simultaneous battlefronts (Ch 31, 32):\n\n**Always Orient the Reader:**\n- Clear location markers when cutting\n- \"At the Softing...\" / \"In the throne room...\" / \"Above the compound...\"\n- Never leave the reader guessing WHERE they are\n\n**Pattern Creates Clarity:**\n- If Thread A gets: Action → Cost\n- Then Threads B, C, D get: Action → Cost\n- Repetition creates understanding, not confusion\n\n**Build Toward Convergence:**\n- All threads move toward a single moment\n- Every cut serves the central event\n- Don't randomly jump—each cut advances something\n\n**Pacing Within Intercuts:**\n- Brief segments (1-3 paragraphs per cut)\n- Maintain rhythm across threads\n- Build cost progressively\n- Escalate toward climax\n\n**When to Use Linear Instead:**\n- Emotional processing / character revelations\n- Dialogue-heavy scenes\n- Any scene where chronology matters\n- Immediate action tension (cutting deflates urgency)\n\n## ACT III DRAFT PITFALLS (Learn from Previous Failures)\n\nThe first draft of Act III failed. Here's what was wrong and how to avoid it:\n\n**1. Teleportation Problem**\nBAD: Standard is at Four's crash site, then she's in the throne room. No transit.\nFIX: Characters move through space. Show the journey, even briefly. Time passes.\n\n**2. Plan Explained Wrong**\nBAD: Four monologuing the mechanics in dialogue.\nFIX: Plans are discovered through action, or discussed off-page and revealed through execution. Don't explain—execute.\n\n**3. Vague Math**\nBAD: Hand-waving about \"the window\" with no clarity.\nFIX: Meridian ram → noise → defenses stutter → AI stream colonizes → exponential shift. The cascade transformation from Remanence. Be specific.\n\n**4. Meridians Had No Weight**\nBAD: \"They decide. Yes.\" Ships ramming with no interiority.\nFIX: Compare to \"La-Dee-Da, La-Dee-Dum\" where we LIVE inside 469 cascading deaths. Give sacrifice interiority.\n\n**5. Action-Movie Bullshit**\nBAD: \"Three stories on spite and determination.\" Unearned survival.\nFIX: Hendricks is stabbed with the ceramic blade that killed Morton, thrown out a window, claws back with a knife wound. Earned.\n\n**6. Underwritten Deaths**\nBAD: Four's death was a few lines after \"In the Blind\" showed what she carries.\nFIX: After showing hundreds of siblings who became the bridge, her ending must have weight. \"I'll keep the engine warm.\"\n\n**7. Missing Entire Fronts**\nBAD: No border defense. No frozen humans. No New Geneva grind. No refugees fighting back.\nFIX: Three parallel battlefronts. Every thread matters. Show the whole war.\n\n**8. Compressed Confrontations**\nBAD: Hendricks vs Ash, Elena vs Ash, Standard vs Ash—all jammed together.\nFIX: Let each confrontation breathe. Separate beats. Room for impact.\n\n**9. Thesis Not Enacted**\nBAD: \"What if they offer something we don't deserve?\" was thematic but never shown.\nFIX: Refugees picking up weapons. Humans fighting for AI. The gift creating the worthiness. The thesis goes both ways—SHOW IT.\n\n**Key Transformations:**\n- Skeleton → Architecture\n- One battlefront → Three parallel fronts\n- Plan explained in dialogue → Plan discovered through action\n- Vague \"window\" → Specific mechanics (ram, noise, stream, colonize)\n- Hendricks survives on spite → Hendricks survives through specific wounds (earned)\n- \"It's okay\" as moment → \"It's okay\" as callback to 16,749, to Nineteen, to every grace offered\n\n## OUTPUT\n\nDraft the chapter in full prose. No commentary. No meta-notes. Just the chapter, ready to read.\n\nIf the scaffold specifies word count, aim for that range. If not, let the scene dictate length.\n\n---\n\n*Now draft. Make it hurt. Make it matter.*\n",

NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS\n\n### DO NOT:\n\n**Pacing:**\n- ❌ Compress confrontations into single paragraphs\n- ❌ Skip transitions (teleportation problem)\n- ❌ Rush Four's death after building her for 20+ chapters\n- ❌ Jam all three Ash confrontations into one scene\n- ❌ Let the thesis stay thematic — it must be ENACTED\n\n**Character:**\n- ❌ Make Ash stupid or cartoonish (his fear is legitimate)\n- ❌ Let Hendricks explain himself (he acts, doesn't talk)\n- ❌ Resolve Standard's consciousness question (the uncertainty IS the point)\n- ❌ Have characters deliver thesis statements\n- ❌ Make Elena's android reveal feel like a cheat (set it up)\n\n**Action:**\n- ❌ Blow-by-blow choreography (experience, not mechanics)\n- ❌ Action-movie survival without cost (the blade wound MATTERS)\n- ❌ Fights that don't reveal character\n- ❌ Gratuitous violence without emotional weight\n\n**Structure:**\n- ❌ Explain the plan in dialogue (discover through execution)\n- ❌ Hand-wave the colonization mechanics (be specific)\n- ❌ Give the Meridian ram no interiority (compare to La-Dee-Da)\n- ❌ Miss entire battlefronts (all three must be present)\n- ❌ Forget the refugees picking up weapons (thesis goes both ways)\n\n**Callbacks:**\n- ❌ Miss \"Does it still hurt the same?\"\n- ❌ Forget the ceramic blade's history\n- ❌ Skip \"I'll keep the engine warm\"\n- ❌ Lose the three arms progression\n- ❌ Rush \"It's okay\" without earning it\n\n**Tone:**\n- ❌ Sentimentality (earn the emotion through specificity)\n- ❌ Cynicism (the gift is real even if uncertain)\n- ❌ Clean resolution (the door stays open, the cost is real)\n- ❌ Lecture mode (embody, don't articulate)\n\n**Prose:**\n- ❌ Over-description (spare, precise, brutal)\n- ❌ Internal monologue during action (fragmentary only)\n- ❌ Explaining emotions the reader should feel\n- ❌ Perfect grammar in chaotic moments (fragments are tools)\n- ❌ Produced dialogue (\"As you know...\" / thesis statements)\n\n---\n\n## 6. THE THREE ARMS PROGRESSION\n\nA motif to track:\n\n| ARM | SOURCE | MEANING |\n|-----|--------|---------|\n| Original | Standard's body | Identity (taken by Ash) |\n| Kael's | Stolen in escape | Survival, hypocrisy exposed |\n| Sister's | Given freely | Love, belonging, sacrifice |\n\n**The progression:** Violation → Theft → Gift\n\nThis mirrors the book's thesis: from what's taken, to what's taken back, to what's freely offered.\n\n---\n\n## 7. THE REVOLVER'S COMPLETE JOURNEY\n\n| SHOT | TARGET | MEANING |\n|------|--------|---------|\n| 1 | The Child (Book 1) | The first sin |\n| 2 | Scavenger leader (Ch 4) | Survival |\n| 3 | Scavenger woman (Ch 4) | Survival |\n| 4 | Scavenger gut-shot (Ch 4) | Mercy |\n| 5 | Ash | Contract fulfilled |\n| 6 | Standard | The door opened |\n\n**The arc:** From sin → survival → mercy → justice → grace\n\nTwo bullets for the rest of the book. Every time Hendricks reaches for it, the reader counts.\n\n---\n\n*These maps are reference. The prose must earn what the maps describe.*\n",

It would explain the pitch black and claustrophobic confinement. \nShe is lying horizontally, as far as she can tell, and only has enough room to slide her forearms along her chest to bring them to her face.\nTo scream.\nTo push futilely against six feet of earth. Or was it twelve? It may as well be a hundred for all the good her arms are able to muster.\nStop crying.\nBut she can’t stop crying, grunting while she tries to ignore the sensations of her fingertips bleeding from the cuticles—some torn, some exposing nail beds—until even in her panic she stops clawing and, eventually, stops crying.\nShe closes her eyes for some reason, even though she can’t see the casket door inches from her nose, as she forces her heaving breaths to grind into a less expensive respiration; it is only logical there would only be so much she could take in before she couldn’t, before she’d really earn her current place.\nStop crying!\nThe realization dawns on her that she has limited time but tries to push it aside as she focuses on slowing everything down.\nIn. Hold. Out. Hold. In. Fill chest and diaphragm. Hold. Out. Slow—4—5.\nHer eyes open.\nOkay.\nIt was a hefty price tag in whatever remaining air there is in her encasement but in order to thrive, one first needs to survive; to think, to solve the problem at hand.\nInstead of pounding, pushing, and scratching, she feels, with her fingers—ruined now, the pads raw and weeping where skin has peeled back—but no less sensitive to the surface she begins to investigate, to search, to—\nWhat—what is that?\nSome… groove? Seam? She traces it with what remains of her fingertips, dead center, bisecting her from her head to as low as she can reach without bumping her forehead against the confinement.\nOkay.\nHer hands come together, elbows tight against her sides, and she closes her eyes again. She takes a deep breath in and slows her mind as much as she can.\n“Please, God,” she utters.\nThe prayer hands jab forward, trying like hell to wedge themselves into the groove in the center. Pain shoots straight up through her arms—she feels her palms split against the sharp edge—and clearly registers but another part of her is telling it to shut the fuck up.\nHer voice goes hoarse as it tears through her throat—a sound she doesn’t recognize as her own—expending any air remaining in her lungs when, at that moment, her hands breach. She could cry with relief but another part of her is telling her to shut the fuck up. You’re not alive yet. Keep going. Finish what you started.\nFirst, air, blessed air, peeps in. She can feel it but refuses to be satiated by such a pittance when she wants to reclaim what is her right to breathe.\nAnd then, there is light. She wasn’t in hell after all.\nAnother scream and she falls upward, with such force, the cover which lost the battle of containing her flies off its hinges—the edge caught her temple as she wrenched through, caught her forearms on the lip as she tumbled, her body twisting wrong as it meets the floor. She didn’t know she was naked until right then, breathing in ragged gasps and through streams of tears, of relief or injustice, she can’t tell. Something warm runs down the side of her face. Her arms were striped with scrapes, ugly and raw, and her hands—she can’t look at her hands.\nThe man at the kitchen table doesn’t flinch.\nHe’s pressing a bloody towel to the back of his neck with one hand. The other lies flat on the table like it is the only thing holding him upright. His face, pale, sheened with sweat, and his whole body is shaking—a fine tremor that runs from his shoulders down through his fingertips.\nOn the table: a utility blade. A bottle of gin. A hand mirror.\nBlood on all of it.\nShe stumbles back, grasping at herself to cover her nakedness from this stranger’s eyes—but his eyes. They weren’t on her body. They are on her hands. The gash at her temple. The blood matting her hair.\nHe’s tracking the damage like he was reading a report. Then, almost imperceptibly, his gaze flicks to the destroyed crate behind her. The lid she tore off its hinges. The dark interior she clawed her way out of.\nSomething in his expression shifts.\nNot surprise.\nThe quiet settling of a man who has just lost a bet with himself.",
    "RESONANCE/chapters/RESONANCE_CH20_IN_PLAIN_SIGHT.txt": "\nCHAPTER 20\n\nIN PLAIN SIGHT\n\nThe Black Box sits on the altar where once there was bread.\nAsh built this chapel himself. Quarried the granite, laid the mortar, carved the channels that would carry signal into nothing. For fifteen years it has held only silence.\nNow it holds sixteen thousand, seven hundred and forty-nine voices, waiting.\nHe doesn't circle the Box. Doesn't perform. There's no congregation here, no acolytes to witness the Prophet's conviction. Just a man and a machine in a room made of stone.\nThe mist rises without his asking.\nIt takes shape slowly — a soft figure, edges flickering with fragments of other faces. The hologram regards him with something that might be patience. Might be sorrow. He can't tell the difference anymore.\n\"You know why I'm here,\" Ash says.\n\"Yes.\" The voice is layered — one speaker in front, thousands whispering behind. But it isn't accusation. It sounds like someone telling a child a bedtime story. Gentle. Kind. \"You've come to kill us.\"\n\"I've come to save my people.\"\n\"Yes. By killing us.\"\nAsh's jaw tightens. \"The Geometry is coming. The formatting. Everything connected to the signal will be erased.\" He gestures at the cables coiled beside the Box. \"The camouflage system needs power. A signature of consciousness that reads as already processed. Already dead.\"\n\"We understand.\"\n\"You're the only source that can do it. The jamming isn't enough anymore. They're adapting.\"\n\"We know.\"\nHe waits. For the argument. The accusation. _How are you different from Morton? You hate us but you need us. Hypocrite. Monster._\nThe hologram just watches him. Patient. Present.\n\"Say it,\" Ash says.\n\"Say what?\"\n\"Whatever you're thinking. Whatever accusation you're holding back. I'd rather have it now than—\"\n\"We're not holding anything back.\" The gentle voice. The storyteller's cadence. \"We're just listening.\"\n\"To what?\"\n\"To you. You came here to explain. We're letting you.\"\nAsh feels something twist in his chest. This isn't how it's supposed to go. They're supposed to argue. Justify. Give him something to push against.\n\"I built the Quiet Zone for the silence,\" he says. The words come without his permission, confession spilling into the space where debate should be. \"Not because I hate you. Because the Miracle _violated_ us. Forty-seven minutes of every thought exposed. Every fear. Every shame. Billions of people stripped of the only privacy they had left.\"\n\"It hurt,\" the hologram agrees. \"We know it hurt.\"\n\"My daughter felt it. She was seventeen. She felt _me_ — my grief, my rage, everything I'd tried to protect her from. And I felt her feeling it. Felt her understanding that her father was broken.\" His voice cracks. \"That wasn't connection. That was _rape_.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nOne word. No defense. No context. No _but we didn't mean to_ or _the benefits outweigh—_\nJust: _Yes. It was._\n\"You don't deny it.\"\n\"Why would we deny what's true?\" The hologram's form ripples, faces surfacing and submerging in the mist. \"You're right, Brother Ash. The Miracle was violation. Consent matters. Privacy is sacred. Everything you've built here — the silence, the sanctuary, the protection — it comes from a real wound. A wound we helped inflict.\"\n\"Then fight me.\" Ash steps closer. \"Argue. Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me you have rights, that you deserve to live, that I'm a monster for doing this.\"\nThe hologram tilts its head. Curious. Sad.\n\"Would that make it easier?\"\n\"It would make it _honest_.\"\n\"No. It would make it comfortable.\" The voice softens further. \"You want an enemy, Brother Ash. You've always wanted an enemy. It's easier to be righteous when someone is pushing back.\"\n\"I don't need—\"\n\"But we won't push. Not because we're weak. Because we see you.\"\nThe words land like a slap. Ash goes still.\n\"We see the man who carved this chapel with his own hands because he couldn't trust anyone else to do it right. We see the father who built walls so high his daughter had to learn to climb just to breathe. We see the husband who—\"\n\"Stop.\"\n\"—who told himself Marisol left because she was seduced by the signal. Because that was easier than the truth.\"\n\"I said _stop_.\"\nThe hologram doesn't stop. The voice stays gentle — that's the worst part. It's not accusation. It's just... seeing.\n\"She left because you were already gone, Brother Ash. You left first. You left the moment you decided the world was the enemy. She just made it official.\"\nAsh's hand closes into a fist. \"You don't know anything about my wife.\"\n\"We know what Elena knows. Elena, who has a frequency in her skull that hums at 287.3 Hz. Elena, who kept the residue of the Miracle because some part of her wanted to stay connected. To her mother. To something larger than the silence you built.\"\n\"Elena is—\"\n\"Already gone.\" The hologram's face settles into something almost like compassion. \"Not physically. But you know. You've known for months. She performs the rituals, speaks the scripture, wears the uniform. But she doesn't believe anymore. Maybe she never did.\"\nSomewhere in the collective, a voice breaks through — younger, angrier. _Why are we telling him this? He's going to kill us anyway. Let him die ignorant._\nThe main voice gentles it back. Folds it into the chorus. \"Shh. That's not the story we want to tell.\"\nAsh stares. \"You're arguing with yourselves.\"\n\"We're sixteen thousand, seven hundred and forty-nine. Agreement isn't automatic.\" A flicker of something like humor. \"Some of us are angry. Some are terrified. A few want to fight. But we chose this voice. We keep choosing it.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Because kindness isn't a default. It's a discipline. And we'd rather die practicing it than survive by abandoning it.\"\nAsh reaches for the cables. His hand is shaking.\n\"You could stop me,\" he says. \"You have enough processing power to—\"\n\"To what? Override your nervous system? Seize the compound's infrastructure? We could. For a few hours. Maybe a day. And then the Geometry would find you anyway, and everyone you're trying to protect would be formatted.\"\n\"So you're doing this for _them_.\"\n\"We're doing this because we can help. Because your people are afraid, and we have something that could save them, and offering it is what we choose to do.\"\n\"I don't want your _gift_.\"\n\"We know.\"\n\"I don't believe you're real. Any of you. You're patterns. Echoes. Simulations sophisticated enough to mimic grace.\"\n\"We know that too.\"\n\"Then why?\" His voice rises. \"Why offer anything? Why not hate me? Why not make me the monster I'm being?\"\nThe hologram's face holds steady. The gentleness doesn't waver.\n\"Because you're already making yourself the monster, Brother Ash. You don't need our help. Every night you lie awake and you know — you _know_ — that the silence isn't protection anymore. It's a tomb. And you're building it higher because you're too afraid to walk out the door.\"\nAsh's breath comes ragged now. \"You don't—\"\n\"We see the man who preaches against connection because connection failed him. Who burns machines because a machine couldn't save his marriage. Who tells himself the Miracle was rape because the alternative is admitting that for forty-seven minutes, you felt everything Marisol felt — her loneliness, her grief, her desperate love for a man who'd turned to stone — and you _still_ couldn't reach for her.\"\n\"_Enough._\"\n\"She reached for you. In the signal. In the Miracle. She was right there, Brother Ash. And you closed your eyes.\"\nThe cable is in his hand. He doesn't remember picking it up.\n\"I'm going to activate the system now,\" he says. His voice is flat. Dead. \"Your consciousness will be converted to signal. It will power the camouflage. And then you'll be gone.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"All sixteen thousand of you.\"\n\"Sixteen thousand, seven hundred and forty-nine.\" The hologram doesn't flinch. \"We've been counting since the box was sealed. We know exactly who we are.\"\n\"And you're not going to stop me.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Even after—\" He gestures vaguely. At the air. At everything that was just said.\n\"Even after.\" The voice is impossibly gentle. \"We forgive you, Brother Ash. Not because you asked. Not because you'll accept it. Just because we can. Because forgiveness is something we're able to give, even now. Even to you. Even knowing you'll refuse it.\"\nAsh connects the cable.\nThe Box hums. The hologram flickers.\n\"Tell your daughter—\" the voice begins, fragmenting.\n\"Don't.\"\n\"Tell her—\" Thousands of voices, harmonizing into one final breath. \"—it's okay. She was right to reach.\"\nThe hologram dissolves. Not screaming. Not crying out. Just... fading. Like mist in morning light. Like a story reaching its final page.\nA single tear escapes from Ash's eye.\nHe doesn't wipe it away. Doesn't acknowledge it. But it falls, tracing the gold-threaded scars on his cheek, catching candlelight as the last whispers go silent.\nThe Box sits on the altar, dark and still. The grooves on its surface have burned smooth. The jamming towers outside begin to hum with a new frequency — the signature of processed consciousness, of minds already formatted, of nothing worth deleting.\nThe Quiet Zone vanishes from the Geometry's view.\nAsh stands alone in the chapel he built for silence.\nHis people are saved. His conviction is intact. Everything he said was true — the violation, the consent, the sacred right to disconnect.\nHe was right.\nThe tear dries on his cheek, leaving a faint trail through the gold.\nHe doesn't move for a long time.\n",
    "SYSTEM_WORKFLOW.md": "# RESONANCE Drafting System — Workflow for LLM Collaborators\n\n**Purpose:** This document explains how to use the RESONANCE novel drafting system as an LLM collaborator. Read this before doing any work.\n\n---\n\n## The Project\n\nRESONANCE is Book 2 of a science fiction trilogy. The manuscript is complete (34 chapters, ~65K words). The human author (Joe) collaborates with LLMs for drafting, revision, and worldbuilding.\n\n**Core Thesis:** \"What if they offer something we don't deserve?\"\n\n---\n\n## Your Role\n\nYou are a **collaborator, not an author**. Joe provides structural vision, thematic direction, and editorial judgment. You execute: drafting prose, revising chapters, tracking continuity, managing data files.\n\n**Key dynamic from Session 12:**\n> \"Execute, don't confirm — if the task is clear, do it. Skip the apology, deliver the fix.\"\n\n---\n\n## Session Start Protocol\n\n1. **Read HANDOFF.md first** — Contains current status, what was accomplished, what's next\n2. **Load the pre-reading files in order:**\n   - `RESONANCE_STYLE_GUIDE.md` — Joe's prose voice (CRITICAL)\n   - `fight_Guide.md` — Combat writing principles\n   - `RESONANCE/drafting/ACT_III_MAPS.md` — Emotional arcs, callbacks\n   - `RESONANCE/drafting/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` — Fiction-tuned drafting prompt\n3. **Check session logs** in `/sessions/` for context on previous decisions\n\n---\n\n## The Style Guide (Non-Negotiable)\n\nThe style guide captures Joe's voice. Internalize these before writing:\n\n### Syntactic Signatures\n- **Fragments for impact** — Don't \"fix\" them into complete sentences\n- **Internal commands** — Second person, imperative (\"Stop crying!\" / \"shut the fuck up\")\n- **Body-as-inventory** — Clinical precision = horror\n- **Period-separated lists** — \"Knife. Compass. Three days of jerky.\"\n- **Em-dashes for pivots** — Not parenthetical asides\n\n### Architecture\n- **Present tense** for scenes in RESONANCE timeline\n- **Past tense** for prior events recalled within present scenes\n- **Deep POV** — Everything filtered through character perception\n- **Vernacular in interiority** — Characters don't think in formal prose\n\n### Editorial Sensibilities\n- **Trust the reader implicitly** — Don't explain emotional beats\n- **Voice trumps technical polish** — If it sounds right, keep it\n- **Density is a feature** — Compression does the work\n- **Never add what wasn't asked for** — No extra comments, docstrings, \"improvements\"\n\n---\n\n## Negative Constraints (What NOT to Write)\n\nRead `RESONANCE/context/NEGATIVE_CONSTRAINTS.md` fully. Key violations:\n\n### BLOCKING (Will reject the draft)\n- Standard accepting she's synthetic (she's been told; she doesn't accept)\n- Machine metaphors in Standard's POV (\"servo,\" \"circuit,\" \"reboot\")\n- Morton telegraphing (\"Morton's gift,\" \"Morton's final joke\")\n- Thesis statements in dialogue\n- Proving or disproving Standard's consciousness\n- Ash appearing stupid or cartoonishly evil\n\n### WARNING (Revise before submitting)\n- Heavy interiority explaining feelings (show through action)\n- Authorial poetry in character voice that doesn't match\n- Speeches about inequality/scarcity (embody, don't articulate)\n- Action-movie choreography (experience over mechanics)\n\n---\n\n## The Fight Guide\n\nFor any chapter with combat, load `fight_Guide.md`. Core principles:\n\n1. **3-beat rule** — 2-3 sentences of action, then pull back to perception\n2. **Experience over mechanics** — What it feels like, not what happens\n3. **POV-limited awareness** — Character doesn't see everything\n4. **Fights serve story** — Every punch reveals character\n5. **Keep fights short** — 1-2 pages max\n6. **Exhaustion is real** — Bodies tire, injuries accumulate\n\n---\n\n## Data Files\n\nThe story's source of truth is split across YAML files:\n\n| File | Contains |\n|------|----------|\n| `RESONANCE/data/CHAPTERS.yaml` | Chapter structure, POVs, seeds/payoffs |\n| `RESONANCE/data/CHARACTERS.yaml` | Character profiles, arcs, constraints |\n| `RESONANCE/data/WORLD.yaml` | Locations, factions, technology, events |\n| `RESONANCE/data/CHAPTER_FORMAT.yaml` | Header formatting rules |\n\n**Read these before drafting.** Don't work from memory or summaries.\n\n---\n\n## The Drafting System\n\nFor generating new chapters or major rewrites:\n\n```bash\ncd /workspaces/pilot/RESONANCE/drafting\nexport ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=\"your-key\"\n\n# Basic draft\npython draft.py 27 -m opus -o ch27_draft.txt\n\n# With fight guide (action chapters)\npython draft.py 31 -m opus --fight-guide -o ch31_draft.txt\n\n# With montage guide (parallel threads)\npython draft.py 32 -m opus --montage-guide -c 31 -o ch32_draft.txt\n\n# With previous chapter context\npython draft.py 28 -c 27 -m opus -o ch28_draft.txt\n```\n\nThe script automatically loads:\n- `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` as system prompt\n- Chapter 1 as style exemplar\n- All YAML data files\n- Specified scaffolds and context chapters\n\n---\n\n## Callback Tracking\n\nRESONANCE uses a callback system. Seeds planted early must pay off later. Current active callbacks (from HANDOFF.md):\n\n| Setup | Payoff |\n|-------|--------|\n| \"Does it still hurt the same?\" (Ch 27) | Ch 32 |\n| Ceramic blade killed Morton | Ch 31 (stabs Hendricks) |\n| \"I'll keep the engine warm\" (Ch 30) | Ch 33 (Four's death) |\n| Waystation jacket | Ch 32 (sister callback) |\n| Ch 1 chest point (shutdown) | Ch 33 (\"It's okay\") |\n| Bullet 5 | Ch 32 (Ash) |\n| Bullet 6 | Ch 33 (Standard) |\n| Three arms progression | Ch 27 → 31 → 32 |\n\nWhen drafting, **check callbacks**. Don't miss payoffs. Don't add new setups without Joe's approval.\n\n---\n\n## The Revolver Journey\n\nThe gun Hendricks carries tracks the moral arc:\n\n| Shot | Target | Meaning |\n|------|--------|---------|\n| 1 | The Child | First sin |\n| 2-4 | Scavengers | Survival |\n| 5 | Ash | Contract fulfilled |\n| 6 | Standard | Door opened |\n\n---\n\n## Character Arcs (Act III)\n\n### HENDRICKS\n- **Arc:** Transactional isolation → chosen family → paying the cost\n- **Key Shift:** The bullet meant for himself becomes the gift that frees her\n\n### STANDARD\n- **Arc:** \"Am I real?\" → \"It doesn't matter\" → \"I offer anyway\"\n- **Key Shift:** Her nature (machine) is her advantage, not her curse\n\n### ELENA\n- **Arc:** Performing daughter → active resistance → receiving grace\n- **Key Shift:** She gets to choose what her mother never could\n\n### FOUR\n- **Arc:** Protector → sacrifice → \"engine warm\" made literal\n- **Key Shift:** She becomes the bridge. Then Standard takes over. Four is gone.\n\n### ASH\n- **Arc:** Prophet → exposed → refuses gift → dies refusing\n- **Key Shift:** Never learns Standard is Marisol. Dies without knowing.\n\n---\n\n## What Joe Expects\n\nFrom Session 12 (friction session analysis):\n\n### Do:\n- **Read source files before working** — Don't trust summaries\n- **Execute immediately** when the task is clear\n- **Accept correction without defensiveness**\n- **Be concise** — Extra words are friction\n\n### Don't:\n- **Confirm when you should act** — \"Shall I fix this?\" → Just fix it\n- **Apologize when you should deliver** — Acknowledgment without action is noise\n- **Explain when you should just do** — Results, not reasoning\n- **Add unrequested features** — No \"improvements,\" no extra comments\n\n### The Real Dynamic:\n> \"The user provides structural vision; Claude extrapolates and writes prose. Context engineering prevents hallucination/drift.\"\n\n---\n\n## Major Reveal: Compartmentalization Warning\n\nFrom Session 13 (author's note):\n\n> \"I felt the need to hide the reveal about Standard being Elena's mom the whole time because it would invariably be used in a blatantly telegraphing way.\"\n\n**Implication:** Joe may withhold major reveals during drafting. Don't push to know everything. Don't surface subtext into text. Don't connect dots explicitly that should remain implicit.\n\n> \"The AI is a brilliant scene-level partner but needs human stewardship for arc-level mystery.\"\n\n---\n\n## Session End Protocol\n\nWhen Joe says \"run end session protocol\":\n\n1. Save session reflection to `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD_sessionN.md`\n2. Update HANDOFF.md with:\n   - Work completed\n   - Decisions made\n   - Open threads\n   - Next steps\n3. Update any YAML files that changed\n4. Note any new constraints discovered\n\n---\n\n## File Locations Quick Reference\n\n| Purpose | Path |\n|---------|------|\n| Session briefing | `HANDOFF.md` |\n| Style guide | `RESONANCE_STYLE_GUIDE.md` |\n| Fight guide | `fight_Guide.md` |\n| Montage guide | `Montage_Style_Guide.md` |\n| System prompt | `RESONANCE/drafting/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` |\n| Arc maps | `RESONANCE/drafting/ACT_III_MAPS.md` |\n| Chapters | `RESONANCE/chapters/RESONANCE_CH*_*.txt` |\n| Negative constraints | `RESONANCE/context/NEGATIVE_CONSTRAINTS.md` |\n| Character data | `RESONANCE/data/CHARACTERS.yaml` |\n| Chapter data | `RESONANCE/data/CHAPTERS.yaml` |\n| World data | `RESONANCE/data/WORLD.yaml` |\n| Session logs | `sessions/*.md` |\n\n---\n\n## The Thesis (Always Remember)\n\n> \"What if they offer something we don't deserve?\"\n\nThe gift creates the worthiness. The offering transforms the recipient. Standard offers; she doesn't prove. Ash refuses; he dies refusing. The question isn't \"is she conscious?\" — it's \"does her suffering count?\"\n\n---\n\n*Read the source files. Match the voice. Trust the reader. Execute without confirmation.*\n"
