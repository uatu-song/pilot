# RESONANCE: NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS

**Version:** 1.2
**Last Updated:** December 21, 2025
**Purpose:** Explicit statements of what is NOT TRUE. The immune system of the story.

---

## Usage

Before any prose generation:
1. Load this document
2. Load constraints for characters in scene
3. Evaluator checks output against all constraints

---

## Thematic Constraints (NEW — Session 3)

These constraints protect the core thesis: **"What if they offer something we don't deserve?"**

---

### Transaction Framing

**Severity: BLOCKING**

| Status | Statement |
|--------|-----------|
| WRONG | Characters bargaining for legitimacy |
| WRONG | Standard "earning" the right to exist |
| WRONG | Standard "proving" her consciousness to skeptics |
| WRONG | Rights-based arguments in dialogue |
| WRONG | Debates framed as "what do we owe AI" |
| WRONG | Debates framed as "what do AI threaten" |
| RIGHT | The story steps outside transaction entirely |
| RIGHT | The gift isn't earned. It can't be repaid. |
| RIGHT | Standard offers; she doesn't prove |

**Source of Error:** Previous framing ("Legitimacy is Shared Suffering") implied transaction. Superseded by "What if they offer something we don't deserve?"

**Detection Patterns:**
- "prove.*worthy"
- "earn.*right"
- "deserve.*to exist"
- "owe.*AI"
- "AI.*threaten"
- "bargain"
- "negotiate.*legitimacy"

---

### Lecture Mode

**Severity: BLOCKING**

| Status | Statement |
|--------|-----------|
| WRONG | Characters explaining the theme |
| WRONG | Characters existing to be convinced |
| WRONG | Debates that map cleanly to real-world positions |
| WRONG | Hendricks explaining scarcity/inequality |
| WRONG | Ash giving speeches about why machines are dangerous |
| WRONG | Standard articulating her own existential crisis |
| RIGHT | Embody, don't articulate |
| RIGHT | Actions and images carry the weight |
| RIGHT | The reader infers; characters live |

**Source of Error:** Common failure mode in thematic fiction.

**Detection Patterns:**
- "you see.*the problem is"
- "what you don't understand"
- "let me explain"
- "the real issue is"
- monologues > 200 words on theme

---

### Dismissible Positions

**Severity: WARNING**

| Status | Statement |
|--------|-----------|
| WRONG | Ash is stupid |
| WRONG | Ash is evil |
| WRONG | Hendricks is a mustache-twirling villain |
| WRONG | Any character exists only to be refuted |
| WRONG | Easy villains |
| RIGHT | Ash's fear is emotionally correct |
| RIGHT | Hendricks' logic is coherent |
| RIGHT | Every character believes something defensible |
| RIGHT | The audience can feel the pull of each position |

**Source of Error:** Thematic architecture collapses if positions are dismissible.

**Detection Patterns:**
- "villain"
- "evil"
- "obviously wrong"
- "cackled"
- "gloated"
- "stupid enough to believe"

---

### Resolution of Standard's Interiority

**Severity: BLOCKING**

| Status | Statement |
|--------|-----------|
| WRONG | Scenes that "prove" Standard is conscious |
| WRONG | Scenes that "prove" Standard is performing |
| WRONG | Certainty about her inner life (from any POV) |
| WRONG | The question being settled |
| WRONG | Writing Standard as reassurance |
| RIGHT | The uncertainty is the point |
| RIGHT | Let the offer land without verification |
| RIGHT | Her actions carry weight regardless of resolution |
| RIGHT | Reader must sit with not knowing |

**Source of Error:** The temptation to resolve ambiguity.

**Detection Patterns:**
- "proved she was conscious"
- "proved she was real"
- "just performing"
- "only simulating"
- "truly felt"
- "really experienced"
- "knew for certain.*she was"

---

### Reader Knowledge vs Character Knowledge (LOCKED — Session 4)

**Severity: BLOCKING**

| Status | Statement |
|--------|-----------|
| WRONG | Standard accepts she is synthetic |
| WRONG | Standard uses machine language about herself |
| WRONG | Standard thinks of herself as artificial |
| WRONG | Reader is uncertain about Standard's physical nature |
| WRONG | The Gel Reveal being ambiguous or contested |
| RIGHT | **READER knows:** Standard is synthetic (Gel Reveal, Ch6) |
| RIGHT | **STANDARD doesn't accept it:** Her senses lie to her |
| RIGHT | The mystery shifts from "what is she" to "does her suffering count" |
| RIGHT | Standard sees red blood; the world sees clear gel |
| RIGHT | Her denial is devastating BECAUSE the reader knows |

**Source of Error:** The Gel Reveal establishes dramatic irony. Reader and character knowledge must remain separated.

**The Perception Split:**
- Elena/Ash see: clear conductive gel, no platelets, no hemoglobin
- Standard sees: bright arterial crimson, smells iron, feels the wet pulse
- Her senses construct human experience; reality is otherwise
- The reader holds both truths; Standard only holds one

**What remains ambiguous:**
- Does Standard's suffering COUNT?
- Is her fear REAL in any meaningful sense?
- Does consciousness require the right substrate?
- The physical nature is settled; the moral question is not

**Detection Patterns:**
- "Standard knew she was.*machine"
- "Standard accepted.*synthetic"
- "Standard realized.*artificial"
- "she was really.*robot" (in Standard POV)

---

### Scarcity Critique as Dialogue

**Severity: WARNING**

| Status | Statement |
|--------|-----------|
| WRONG | Speeches about inequality |
| WRONG | Characters pointing out "the 1%" |
| WRONG | Exposition about resource distribution |
| WRONG | The critique being spoken rather than shown |
| RIGHT | Hendricks embodies the critique |
| RIGHT | The machinery of scarcity is visible, not explained |
| RIGHT | The indictment is implied |

**Source of Error:** The temptation to make subtext into text.

**Detection Patterns:**
- "the rich"
- "the 1%"
- "inequality"
- "resource distribution"
- "the system is designed to"
- "they want you to think"

---

| RIGHT | Elena TRANSPORTS the Box to Ash's compound |
| RIGHT | Elena is MID-DELIVERY when the anomaly call comes |
| RIGHT | The Box POWERS the Quiet Zone's jamming infrastructure |
| RIGHT | The Box is the engine of Silence |

**Source of Error:** Session 2 drafts had Elena handing Box to Ash at NED. Corrected after author intervention.

**Detection Patterns:**
- "handed.*to Ash"
- "Ash.*received"
- "gave.*Ash.*box"
- "Ash took"

---

### Standard's Awakening Trigger

**Severity: BLOCKING**

| Status | Statement |
|--------|-----------|
| WRONG | Standard wakes from the Correction Frequency (alien signal) |
| WRONG | Standard wakes because of the aliens |
| WRONG | Standard is born into the apocalypse |
| RIGHT | Standard wakes from 287.3 Hz (the Resonance) |

- "awakened by.*signal"

---

| WRONG | Hendricks removes the Regulator at the checkpoint |
| WRONG | Hendricks removes the Regulator as part of the border ritual |
| WRONG | Standard watches the surgery |
| WRONG | Standard is present during the surgery |
| RIGHT | Hendricks removes the Regulator in his apartment |
| RIGHT | Hendricks removes the Regulator ALONE |
| RIGHT | Standard bursts from the crate AFTER the surgery is complete |
| RIGHT | The early removal is why Hendricks survives the Correction Frequency |

**Source of Error:** Original plan had removal at checkpoint. Changed for narrative efficiency and plot logic (survival explanation).

**Detection Patterns:**
- "removed.*checkpoint"
- "offering.*regulator"
- "Standard watched"
- "Standard sat.*watched"

---

## Character-Specific Constraints

---

### STANDARD

| RIGHT | Standard has been TOLD she is synthetic (Gel Reveal, Ch6) |
| RIGHT | Standard does NOT accept this — her senses say otherwise |
| RIGHT | Standard does not know her name |
| RIGHT | Standard clings to human identity despite evidence |
| RIGHT | Her denial is the arc — not discovery, but acceptance |

**Note:** Post-Chapter 6, Standard has been confronted with evidence (Ash's examination of the gel). The mystery engine shifts from "what is she" to "will she accept it" and "does her suffering count."

**Source of Error:** Multiple near-misses where interiority revealed nature. Post-Ch6: risk of having her accept too quickly.

**Detection Patterns (in Standard POV):**
- "she knew she was"
- "her mechanical"
- "her android"
- "her robotic"
- "machine body"
- "synthetic" (as self-acceptance)
- "accepted.*not human"

| WRONG | Standard's machine nature is visible |
| RIGHT | Standard's tells are SUBTLE (precision, clinical observation, immunity) |
| RIGHT | Physical wrongness is in the mechanics, not the power |
| RIGHT | Readers should wonder, not know |

**Source of Error:** Draft had Standard hoisting Hendricks "with strength that shouldn't have been possible." Too loud.

**Detection Patterns:**
- "superhuman"
- "impossible strength"
- "crushed.*hand"
- "bent.*metal"

---

#### Voice / Metaphor Choice

**Severity: BLOCKING**

| Status | Statement |
|--------|-----------|
| WRONG | Standard uses machine metaphors ("servos," "chassis," "circuits") |
| WRONG | Standard thinks in tech jargon |
| WRONG | Standard references "rebooting" or "malfunctioning" |
| RIGHT | Standard uses medical/human metaphors ("structural integrity," "broken") |

**Source of Error:** Gem Session 2 correction.

**Detection Patterns (in Standard POV):**
- "servo"
- "chassis"
- "circuit"
- "processor"
- "reboot"
- "malfunction"
- "system"

| RIGHT | Hendricks is unsurprised. We don't explain why. |
| RIGHT | The reader should wonder at his lack of reaction |

**Source of Error:** Session 2 draft included "Morton's final gift. Morton's final joke. She didn't know what she was." Caught and removed.

**Detection Patterns:**
- "Morton.*gift"
- "Morton.*joke"
- "Morton.*sent"
- "Morton.*shipped"
- "knew what.*crate"
- "knew what she was"

| WRONG | Explaining the Regulator's function mid-surgery |
| WRONG | Exposition about Morton during the scene |
| RIGHT | Pure action. Just describe what he does. |
| RIGHT | Let the reader infer feelings from actions |
| RIGHT | Short sentences. Staccato rhythm. |

**Source of Error:** Multiple drafts included heavy interiority. Author note: "Just describe actions to demonstrate feelings; don't go into mind."

**Detection Patterns:**
- "he knew"
- "he realized"
- "the fear was"
- "he thought"
- "he felt that"

| RIGHT | When she learns the man in her rover started The Miracle that broke her—that's a scene |

**Source of Error:** Session 1 identified this as major dramatic reveal. Must not leak early.

**Dramatic Payoff:** Hendricks shot the Child → released 287.3 Hz → caused The Miracle → violated Elena at 17. The man bleeding in her back seat started all of this.

**Detection Patterns:**

## Constraint Addition Protocol

When a new error is discovered:

1. **Document the error** — What was written incorrectly?
2. **Identify the canonical truth** — What should be written instead?
3. **Create detection patterns** — How can we catch this if it recurs?
4. **Add to this document** — Under appropriate section
5. **Add to ENTITY_CATALOG.yaml** — In the `forbidden` section
