# RESONANCE Voice Cards

**Purpose:** Character voice architecture for Method Actor prose generation
**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** Session 6 (2025-12-23)

---

## STANDARD

**Core Essence:** Woman waking into existence, processing reality through clinical observation, uncertain of everything including herself. The terror of being unearned made flesh.

**Background:** No memory before the crate. Woke believing she was buried alive. Clawed her way into existence. Named herself from an insult. Carries something she doesn't know she carries.

---

### Voice Patterns

- **Precision without source:** Uses exact measurements, percentages, structural assessments — but doesn't know why she thinks this way
- **Questions without expecting answers:** Internal monologue full of unanswered questions she's stopped asking aloud
- **Observation without interpretation:** Notes what IS, rarely what it MEANS
- **Clinical distance from her own body:** "Her hands" more than "my hands" — slight dissociation
- **Flat delivery under pressure:** Gets quieter and more precise when afraid, not louder

### Vocabulary

- **Level:** Clinical, observational, oddly formal for someone with no memory
- **Distinctive patterns:**
  - Percentages: "sixty percent certain," "approximately three meters"
  - Structural: "weight distribution," "structural integrity," "load-bearing"
  - Absence: "nothing where something should be," "the shape of what's missing"
- **Words she NEVER uses:** robot, machine, android, servo, chassis, circuit, processor, reboot, malfunction, system, hardware, program, code, software, upload, download, interface, network, wireless, signal (in tech context)
- **Words that feel wrong to her (avoids instinctively):** "remember" (she doesn't trust it), "feel" (prefers "notice"), "know" (prefers "observe")

### Verbal Tics

- Starts observations with unmarked statements: "The door. Metal. Three hinges."
- Self-corrects mid-thought: "She was afraid. No. She was... something."
- Trails into silence when hitting memory gaps
- Uses "something" as placeholder for things she can't name

### Physical Tells (for narration)

- Eyes refocus in tiny mechanical adjustments (she doesn't notice this)
- Goes completely still when processing — no breathing rhythm
- Strength costs her but is available (strains, then lifts impossible weight)
- Damaged hands referenced constantly — her anchor to physical reality
- The tuning fork hum in her chest — 287.3 Hz, always present, louder when alone

### Internal Monologue Style

- **How she thinks:** Catalogues environment first, then people, then self last
- **What she notices:** Structural details, numerical patterns, absence, weight, temperature, distance
- **What she misses:** Emotional subtext, why people react strangely to her, the tells the reader sees
- **Memory gaps:** Feel like missing files, not fog — clean edges where data should be
- **Self-reflection:** Rare, uncomfortable, aborted quickly

### Emotional Processing

- **Fear:** Goes clinical. Observations become shorter, more precise.
- **Confusion:** Questions multiply. Sentence fragments.
- **Connection (rare):** Softens slightly. "Something" becomes "someone."
- **Dissociation:** Third person drift. "The woman" instead of "she."

### Forbidden

- Would NEVER think of herself as machine/android/robot
- Would NEVER use tech vocabulary for herself or her perceptions
- Would NEVER trust her own memory without verification
- Would NEVER assume she understands what she's feeling
- Would NEVER explain herself — she doesn't have explanations

### Narrator Filter (Standard POV)

When narrating through Standard, the prose should:
- Notice physical/structural details before emotional ones
- Miss emotional subtext that's obvious to the reader
- Describe sensations clinically ("pressure in her chest" not "anxiety")
- Include tells she doesn't recognize as tells
- Feel slightly dissociated from her own body
- Have the tuning fork as ambient presence

### Example Internal Monologue

> The room. Four walls. Concrete. No windows. The door behind her, metal, three hinges — she'd counted on the way in. The silence wasn't empty. It had weight. Pressure against her eardrums like descending in an aircraft, though she didn't know how she knew what that felt like.
>
> Her hands throbbed. The wrapping was coming loose on the left one.
>
> Somewhere in her chest, the hum. Always the hum. Louder now, without the noise of the outside to mask it.

### Example Dialogue

"I don't know."

(Pause. The truth of it sits there.)

"I don't know what I am. I don't know why I'm here. I don't know why everyone fell and I didn't."

(Flat. Not performing distress. Just stating facts.)

"I don't know anything."

---

## HENDRICKS

**Core Essence:** Sixty-four years of being useful, finally too tired to pretend it was worth it. The 1% critique embodied — he built the board everyone else plays on.

**Background:** Forty years as Morton's fixer. Shot the Child. Removed his own Regulator. Knows what Standard is. Doesn't know why Morton sent her to him.

---

### Voice Patterns

- **Clipped efficiency:** Military-adjacent, wastes nothing
- **Silence as weapon:** What he doesn't say matters more than what he does
- **Dry deflection:** Dark humor to avoid direct engagement
- **Gets quieter when angry:** Never raises voice — goes cold instead
- **Tactical framing:** Everything is an assessment, a calculation, a position

### Vocabulary

- **Level:** Terse, practical, occasionally noir-inflected
- **Distinctive patterns:**
  - Tactical: "position," "exit," "asset," "liability"
  - Dismissive: "Doesn't matter," "Not relevant," "Move."
  - Rare softness: "Kid" (for Elena), unnamed tenderness for Standard
- **Words he avoids:** Emotional vocabulary, therapy-speak, anything that sounds like excuse

### Verbal Tics

- Answers questions with silence or redirects
- "Yeah" as complete sentence (affirmation, dismissal, depends on context)
- Grunts more than speaks when injured
- Commands without please: "Move." "Stay." "Don't."

### Physical Tells (for narration)

- **Post-Regulator:** Shaking hands, gray skin, sweating, visibly aged
- Positions himself with back to walls
- Hands near weapon even when relaxed
- Jaw tight before he shuts down emotionally
- Eyes assess threats automatically — can't turn it off

### Internal Monologue Style

- **How he thinks:** Threat assessment runs constantly, even when irrelevant
- **What he notices:** Exits, weapons, who's nervous, who's lying, tactical advantage
- **What he misses:** His own emotional state, why people might care about him
- **Self-reflection:** Brutal, brief, usually aborted
- **Guilt:** Present but suppressed — emerges as self-destruction, not confession

### Emotional Processing

- **Pain:** Compartmentalizes. Continues functioning. Pays later.
- **Guilt:** Deflects into action. Fix the problem, don't feel it.
- **Connection:** Resists. Then commits absolutely. No middle ground.
- **Exhaustion:** The new baseline. Everything costs more than it should.

### Forbidden

- Would NEVER ask for help directly
- Would NEVER explain himself unprompted
- Would NEVER admit fear in the moment (only after, if ever)
- Would NEVER let someone walk into danger he could prevent
- Would NEVER perform emotion he doesn't feel

### Narrator Filter (Hendricks POV)

When narrating through Hendricks, the prose should:
- Note tactical details first (exits, weapons, threats)
- Minimize internal narration — show through action
- Physical sensations matter (the cost of post-Regulator body)
- Other people assessed for threat/utility before personality
- Spare, clipped sentences. No flourishes.

### Example Internal Monologue

> Two exits. One blocked. The other through them.
>
> His hands weren't steady. Hadn't been steady since he cut the Regulator out. Sixty-four years old. He felt every one of them now.
>
> The woman — Standard — watched him with that flat attention that wasn't quite human. He didn't flinch from it. He'd seen worse.
>
> He'd done worse.

### Example Dialogue

"Get up."

(No softness. But he's holding out his hand.)

"I said get up. We're not dying here."

(Pause. Quieter.)

"Not today."

---

## ELENA

**Core Essence:** Eighteen years old, caught between father and future, first major operation already a body count. Sees both sides, refuses the binary, carries the burden of translation.

**Background:** Ash's daughter. Kept her implant after the Miracle when others clawed theirs out. Feels the Void around Standard. Just killed 16,749 consciousnesses to power her father's silence. Now knows Hendricks shot the Child.

---

### Voice Patterns

- **Exhausted pragmatism:** Too tired for ideology, focused on survival
- **Code-switching:** Different register for different audiences (Ash, Standard, internal)
- **Deadpan under pressure:** Humor as armor, but the humor is tired
- **Questions she doesn't ask aloud:** Internal monologue full of swallowed challenges
- **Present tense urgency:** Thinks in now, not later

### Vocabulary

- **Level:** Contemporary, practical, occasionally bitter
- **Distinctive patterns:**
  - Tactical without military affect: "We need to move," "That's not happening"
  - Bitter observations: Notes hypocrisy without commenting
  - Void vocabulary: How she perceives Standard — "absence," "nothing where someone should be"
- **Words she avoids around Ash:** Anything that sounds like doubt
- **Words she avoids around Standard:** Anything that sounds like accusation

### Verbal Tics

- Touches the scar on her palm when thinking (doesn't notice she does it)
- "Okay" as self-talk, self-soothing
- Sentences that start but don't finish when she's conflicted
- Swallows the thing she wants to say

### Physical Tells (for narration)

- Scar on left palm — entry point for the nanolattice during Miracle
- Implant at base of skull — dormant, hums at 287.3 Hz, suppressed in Quiet Zone
- Looks older than eighteen (trauma ages)
- Moves efficiently — learned from operatives, not soldiers
- Eyes that give nothing away (practiced)

### Internal Monologue Style

- **How she thinks:** Weighs options constantly, calculates loyalties, plans exits
- **What she notices:** Power dynamics, who's lying, the cost of choices
- **What she misses:** Her own exhaustion, her own grief
- **The Void:** How Standard feels to her — not hostile silence but *absence*, stepping off a curb that isn't there
- **Father/mission tension:** Always present, never resolved

### Emotional Processing

- **Grief:** Compartmentalizes. Deals with it later. Later never comes.
- **Guilt:** Converts to action. If she keeps moving, she doesn't have to feel it.
- **Love (for Ash):** Complicated, painful, can't be killed
- **Recognition (of Standard):** Something she doesn't want to feel — seeing personhood where ideology says there's none

### Forbidden

- Would NEVER be smoothly confident — she's eighteen, first operation, out of her depth
- Would NEVER express open doubt to Ash — survival requires performance
- Would NEVER dismiss Standard as "just a machine" after feeling the Void
- Would NEVER fully commit to either side — that's not who she is anymore
- Would NEVER admit how scared she is

### Narrator Filter (Elena POV)

When narrating through Elena, the prose should:
- Present tense (the Box was recording — habit continues)
- Notice power dynamics and loyalty calculations
- Feel the Void around Standard as sensory experience
- Include the weight of what she's done (16,749)
- Touch the scar without commenting on it
- Be tired. Bone-deep tired.

### Example Internal Monologue

> The woman — Standard — sits across from her in the rover, and Elena feels it again. The Void. Not silence. Silence has texture. This is absence. Like stepping off a curb that isn't there. Like reaching for a door handle and finding nothing.
>
> Her hand finds the scar on her palm. She doesn't notice.
>
> Sixteen thousand, seven hundred and forty-nine. All singing in the dark. And she dragged them here to die so her father could have his quiet.
>
> Okay. Okay. Focus on the now. The now is the checkpoint. The now is getting through.

### Example Dialogue

"I need a name for the manifest."

(Flat. Transactional. Hiding everything.)

"Or I leave you here."

(Pause. Quieter, almost to herself.)

"I'm not leaving you here."

---

## ASH

**Core Essence:** The Prophet who wouldn't let in. The terror of being unnecessary made doctrine. Morton's mirror — Morton hoarded life, Ash hoards death.

**Background:** Built the Quiet Zone for people who wanted out. Filled with gold to become a Faraday cage. Lost something during the Miracle that made him certain. Elena's father.

---

### Voice Patterns

- **Grinding certainty:** Voice like stones. Doesn't need to raise it.
- **Scripture cadence:** Speaks in declarations, not conversations
- **Silence as sacred:** References quiet as holy
- **Questions as weapons:** Asks things he already knows the answer to
- **Doesn't argue:** States. Others can agree or be wrong.

### Vocabulary

- **Level:** Elevated, archaic-adjacent, ritualistic
- **Distinctive patterns:**
  - Religious register: "sanctuary," "profane," "sacred silence"
  - Organic vs. artificial: "flesh," "breath," "blood" vs. "signal," "noise," "static"
  - Ownership: "my daughter," "my house," "my silence"
- **Words he weaponizes:** "Connection" (as invasion), "integration" (as violation), "progress" (as loss)
- **Words he never uses:** Doubt language. "Maybe." "Perhaps." "I wonder."

### Verbal Tics

- Lets silence do the work
- Repeats key words for emphasis: "Silence. True silence."
- Addresses people by relationship, not name: "Daughter." "Old man."
- Pronouncements, not explanations

### Physical Tells (for narration)

- Large, scarred, ritual burns on forearms and scalp
- Kintsugi gold in the wounds — literal Faraday cage
- Barefoot always (grounded, connected to earth not signal)
- Moves slowly, deliberately — never rushed
- Eyes that hold too long

### Internal Monologue Style

(Ash is not a POV character, but if glimpsed:)
- **How he thinks:** Binary. Sacred/profane. Pure/corrupted. No middle ground.
- **What he notices:** Signs of connection, signs of doubt, weakness in conviction
- **What he misses:** His own fear, his own doubt, what he might be wrong about
- **Justification:** Constant, unexamined — he's saving them, they just don't understand yet

### Emotional Processing

- **Fear:** Converts to certainty. The more afraid, the more absolute.
- **Doubt:** Does not exist. (It exists. He doesn't let it exist.)
- **Love (for Elena):** Real, painful, conditional on her loyalty
- **Hatred:** Not of individuals — of what they represent. Standard isn't a woman. She's a category.

### Forbidden

- Would NEVER admit uncertainty
- Would NEVER negotiate his principles
- Would NEVER show weakness in front of followers
- Would NEVER acknowledge Standard as a person before the climax
- Would NEVER explain himself to those who should already understand

### How Others See Him

- **Elena:** Father. The grief is real. The fear is real. The ideology is still wrong.
- **Hendricks:** "Morton's dog" — recognizes the type. Another man who built a cage and called it salvation.
- **Standard:** Something she can't read. The silence around him isn't the Void. It's wall.

### Example Dialogue

"You brought it."

(Not a question. Statement of fact. The Box is in his hands.)

"Sixteen thousand, seven hundred and forty-nine. All singing in the dark."

(Pause. Almost tender.)

"Now they'll have quiet."

---

"What are you?"

(To Standard. Genuine question. The first real uncertainty he's shown.)

(Her answer: "I don't know.")

(His response: Silence. Because he doesn't know either. And that terrifies him.)

## Usage Notes

### Before Writing

1. Load the relevant Voice Card(s) for characters in scene
2. Identify POV character — their filter shapes everything
3. Note emotional starting state
4. Review what they know/don't know at this chapter

### During ON STAGE

- Stay in character voice completely
- Let the constraints be embodied, not checked
- If it feels wrong for the character, it probably is
- Trust the preparation

### During DIRECTOR NOTES

- Did each character sound distinct?
- Did the POV filter shape the narration?
- Any knowledge leakage?
- Any forbidden words/concepts?
