The clothes don’t fit.
Standard adjusts the collar of the borrowed uniform — silver and white, Sovereignty formal wear — and watches Elena’s reflection in the viewport. Elena is talking. She’s been talking for the last hour, a steady stream of instruction disguised as conversation.
“Chin up when they address you. Not too high — that’s arrogance. Just enough to suggest you’re listening from somewhere above. And when they ask questions—”
“Answer in fragments. Let you interpret.”
“Exactly.” Elena’s hands move, adjusting folds, smoothing creases. Nervous energy channeled into textile management. “You’re not here to convince them. You’re here to be convinced of. There’s a difference.”
The hum is loud today. Standard can feel it pressing against the inside of her skull, a frequency that doesn’t match anything in the ship’s ambient noise. She’s learned to ignore it. Mostly.
“And if they ask about the Geometry?”
“Tell them you don’t remember. That’s true, so it’s easy. If they push, look troubled. Like the memory is there but painful.” Elena steps back, assessing her work. “They want mystery. Give them mystery.”
“What if I say the wrong thing?”
Elena’s composure flickers. Just for a moment.
“Then I fix it. That’s what I’m here for.”
Standard watches her. This woman who saved a man she had every reason to hate. Who armed Standard without asking why. Who hasn’t slept in thirty hours but won’t admit it.
“Why are you helping me?”
The question lands wrong. Elena’s hands stop moving.
“Because if you die, we all die. That’s the transaction.” She turns away, toward the door. “The council convenes in ten minutes. Hendricks will escort you. I’ll be at your left.”
She leaves before Standard can respond.
The viewport shows stars. Somewhere beyond them, Earth is being eaten by geometry. Standard doesn’t know what that means. She knows it’s happening. She knows people are dying. She knows she walked through the thing that’s killing them and came out the other side.
She doesn’t know why.
The hum rises. Falls. Rises again.
*You don't have to know what you are to know what you should do.*
The thought arrives without origin. She doesn't know if it's hers.

The air in the Council Chamber is scrubbed too clean. It smells like industrial filtration and expensive lies.
Hendricks stands in the back, deep in the shadows near the blast doors, leaning against the cold metal wall. He keeps his hands loose, near his belt. He isn’t technically armed—they made him leave the heavy ordinance at the checkpoint—but he has a ceramic shiv in his boot and a lot of pent-up aggression, which feels like enough.
He watches the table. The “Council of Strangers.” A mix of Sovereignty brass who look like they’ve never missed a meal, and Terminist freaks who look like they’ve never eaten one.
And in the middle of them, sitting in a chair that looks too big for her: Standard.
She is too still. Hendricks hates when she gets that still. It reminds him of the factory settings. The default mode. Template 3.
“This is a violation of the Containment Protocols,” the gaunt one—Kael—says. He spits the words like they taste bad. “You invited a machine into the war room.”
Hendricks feels his jaw tighten. *Don't do it,* he tells himself. *Don't walk over there and break his nose.*
Whittaker tries to intervene, but she is weak. The stress is eating her alive. Kael steamrolls right over her.
“She is a security breach wearing a stolen face!” Kael slams his hand down. “I don’t care if she glows in the dark. It’s a trick.”
The murmurs start. Fear is contagious, and the Terminist is patient zero.
Elena steps forward.
She doesn’t ask for permission. She just occupies the space, putting herself physically between Standard and the accusation.
“A simulation,” Elena says. Her voice is clear, cutting through the grumbling. “That’s an interesting theory, Bishop. Can I call you Bishop? Or do you prefer ‘Inquisitor’?”
The gaunt man narrows his eyes. “I am Elder Kael. And I speak for—”
“You speak for the faction that thinks radio waves are sin,” Elena cuts him off. She walks the length of the table, making eye contact with every Council member. “You wear acoustic dampeners woven by automated looms. You eat protein paste synthesized by fabrication units. You used a long-range comms relay to accept this invitation.”
She stops in front of him.
“You don’t hate machines, Elder. You just hate the ones you can’t control.”
“You are Ash’s daughter,” Kael sneers. “Don’t lecture me on hypocrisy. Your father built a fortress to hide from the very thing you’re defending.”
“My father is a terrified old man hiding in a hole,” Elena snaps. The silence in the room goes sharp. She hasn’t said it out loud before. It feels like breaking a bone—painful, and necessary.
“I was raised in the Quiet Zone,” she continues, her voice dropping, forcing them to lean in. “I know the scripture better than anyone in this room. I know the warnings. The signal corrupts. The machine deceives.”
She gestures to Standard, who sits perfectly still.
“But I also know tactics. And I know that when the sky is deleting forty percent of the planet, you don’t shoot the only person who knows how to walk through the fire just because you don’t like her origin story.”
“She has no origin!” Kael stands up. “She is a void! A glitch!”
“She is an asset!” Elena slams her hand on the table. It hurts, but she doesn’t flinch. “Let’s talk numbers, since you think she’s just math. We have lost four billion people in twelve hours. The Sovereignty’s fleets are grounded. The Terminists are praying at the edge of the deletion zones and getting erased mid-amen.”
She looks at Whittaker.
“We are losing. We aren’t just losing the war; we are being uninstalled. And you want to waste time debating the theology of the one thing—the only thing—that has survived contact with the enemy?”
“It’s a risk,” Admiral Tien says from the end of the table. “If she is a Trojan horse—”
“Then we’re dead,” Elena parries. “But we’re dead anyway, Admiral. Look at the map.” She points to the hologram above them. “That red line isn’t stopping. We don’t have the luxury of vetting our saviors for purity. We need a way in. She is the way in.”
“She is a Template Three,” Kael spits. “A sex bot. A servant. You want us to pin the survival of the human race on a unit designed to fetch slippers?”
Elena laughs. It’s a cold, sharp sound.
“I find it interesting,” she says, “that you’re so obsessed with what she was designed for, and so terrified of what she’s choosing to do.”
She walks back to Standard’s side. She rests a hand on the back of Standard’s chair—not a guard, but a second.
“You say she’s just code. Just a servant. Fine. Let’s assume you’re right.”
Elena looks around the room.
“I watched this ‘servant’ hold a VTOL steady while taking fire from eight interceptors. I watched her walk into a prison cell to sit with a dying man she didn’t know. I watched her kneel in the mud to comfort a woman who worshipped her.”
She looks Kael dead in the eye.
“If that’s what a machine does, Elder, then maybe we should all be praying for an upgrade.”
Kael’s face goes purple. “This is blasphemy. She has bewitched you. She is running a social engineering protocol—”
“She’s saving your ass!” Elena shouts. “And you’re too proud to let her!”
The room is dead silent. 
Elena takes a breath. She smooths her borrowed uniform. When she speaks again, her voice is quiet, deadly calm.
“My name is Elena Vasquez. I am a Lieutenant of the Quiet Zone. I have killed for the silence. I have bled for the doctrine.
“And I am telling you: looking at her and seeing a threat is the last mistake you will ever make.”
Elder Kael stares at her, his mouth a thin line of hate. “Does it have a voice?” he sneers. “Or does the puppet only move when you pull the strings?”
Elena steps in front of Standard, blocking Kael’s view entirely. She doesn’t look back at Standard. She keeps her eyes locked on the Terminist.
“She doesn’t have to explain herself to you,” Elena says, her voice hard. “She is the asset. I am the handler. If you have questions about her utility, you ask me. If you have concerns about her loyalty, you file a grievance with the Admiral.”
She grabs the back of Standard’s chair.
“Until then, she is under my protection. And we are done here.”
Elena looks at Commander Whittaker.
“Permission to withdraw, Commander.”
It isn’t a question. Elena is already turning, her hand dropping to Standard’s shoulder, a silent command to get up, let’s go, don’t look at them.
Whittaker hesitates, then nods. “Granted. Take the—”
“You want to know what I am.”
The voice is soft, but in the acoustic perfection of the chamber, it sounds like a gavel strike.
Elena freezes. Her hand is still on Standard’s shoulder. Her fingers tighten, a frantic, silent warning. Don’t. Shut up. We’re leaving.
“Stan,” Elena hisses under her breath. “Don’t.”
Standard stands up.
She brushes Elena’s hand off her shoulder. Not roughly. Just... inevitably. Like a tide ignoring a sandcastle.
She turns to face Kael.
“You say I’m just code,” she says. “That I’m a slave to my instructions.”
Elena steps back, her face draining of color. She looks at Whittaker, then at Standard. The shield is gone. The weapon is talking.
Standard nods slowly.
“You’re right. I am.”
