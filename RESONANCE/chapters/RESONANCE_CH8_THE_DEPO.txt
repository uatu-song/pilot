CHAPTER 8

THE DEPO'

The roads give out somewhere past the thirty-mile marker.
It isn't gradual. An old elevated freeway interchange has collapsed into a massive sinkhole—a bowl of shattered asphalt and twisted steel girders that look like the bleached ribs of a flayed giant. A broken water main somewhere in the dark has turned the debris into liquid concrete, gray mud that sucks at the Rover's tires with heavy, rhythmic persistence.
Elena doesn't announce it. The Rover bottoms out with a violent grind-screech as a rusted rebar spike catches the undercarriage. The smell of scorched rubber fills the cabin.
She flips the switch.
The Rover shudders. The axles shift upward and copper-wound induction skids deploy with a mechanical grind. The tires stop fighting. The cabin levels as they rise four inches, suspended on a magnetic cushion gripping the buried metal beneath.
"Riding the bones," Elena mutters.
They float forward on the induction skids, pulling against old subway tunnels and pipe networks—the skeleton of the world before. The fusion gauge drops faster now. 24%. 23%. Every inch of forward momentum is a trade against the remaining life of the core.
The high-frequency whine makes Elena's teeth ache. Hendricks groans in the back. Standard sits in the passenger seat, hands folded, watching the gray wasteland scroll past with eyes that don't seem to blink.
The silence stretches. Minutes. Miles.
Hendricks breaks it first.
"Where are we going?"
Elena doesn't look back. "Somewhere safe."
"That's not an answer."
"It's the only one you're getting."
Hendricks files this. Doesn't press. But Standard notices: Elena isn't fleeing. She has a destination. She's not sharing it.
The silence returns. Elena can't take it anymore.
"The revolver," she says.
Hendricks stirs. "What about it."
"You carry a Smith & Wesson. Prewar. Exposed hammer. Six chambers." She maneuvers around a jagged slab of fallen overpass, the skids throwing blue sparks where they brush exposed iron. "It's a museum piece."
"You know your weapons."
"I know that's dead weight. There's no ammunition left. The primer chemistry is lost—you can't fab those rounds. So why carry it?"
Hendricks is quiet. Then: "Had some."
"Had."
"Still have two."
"Two rounds." Elena's laugh comes out brittle. "In a world with magpulse rifles and the Geometry hovering overhead, you're walking around with two bullets."
"Three more than most people."
"For what? Nostalgia?"
"You know what a revolver does that your fancy pulse weapon doesn't?" Hendricks shifts, and she hears the wet slide of his bandages. "Works without power. No grid. No charge. No signal. Just the hammer and the round. Point, pull, done. The Geometry can't shut it off because there's nothing to shut off."
Elena considers this. The Rover hums over a patch of buried rebar—she feels it through the floor, the thrum of century-old metal. "Still only two rounds."
"Then I better not miss."
"NED used to make a sidearm," Elena says. "The Quietus. Totally sealed system—worked in vacuum, underwater, inside a Faraday cage. My father's people found a cache in an old bunker."
"I remember the Quietus." Hendricks sounds almost amused. "Ugly as sin. Felt like holding a brick."
"You've fired one?"
"Helped design the grip."
Elena looks at him in the mirror. "You worked for NED?"
"Morton-Kess Applied Consciousness. Before the Miracle." A pause. "Before NED bought what was left."
"So you're old."
"I'm experienced."
"You're ancient."
"And you ride the induction too hot." Hendricks coughs, leaving a red smear on his lip. "Feel that vibration? You're burning the coils. They're forty years old and you're pushing them like they're fresh from the fab."
"The coils are rated for—"
"Back off the draw before you fuse the skids to the rebar."
"Okay, grandpa."
"Okay, princess."
From the passenger seat, a small sound. Almost a breath.
Elena glances over. Standard is watching them. Her face is neutral, but there's something around her eyes—not quite a smile, but the architecture of one.
"You're enjoying this," Elena says.
"You talk differently to him now," Standard says. "Than before."
Elena doesn't answer. She was about to deny it.
"The revolver," Standard says.
Hendricks tenses. Elena sees it in the mirror—subtle, but there.
"Elena described an exposed hammer," Standard continues. "Single-action. You'd have to cock it manually for each shot. Unless you fanned it."
Elena blinks. "You know about fanning?"
"Pulling the trigger while striking the hammer with the off-hand. Faster than cocking. Less accurate." Standard tilts her head. "Impractical for two rounds. But possible."
Hendricks says nothing. His hand drifts toward his coat.
"You used three rounds on the scavengers," Standard says. "At the stairs. I was there. You said you have two left."
Silence.
"Six chambers. Three spent on the scavengers. Two remaining." Standard's voice is even, curious. "What did you use the first round on?"
The air in the cabin changes. Elena feels it—a weight pressing down. Hendricks' jaw tightens. His hand stops over the coat, over the weight beneath it.
He's about to tell her.
The first bullet hits the Rover like a hammer on a bell.
Hendricks flinches. And then his whole body settles. The tension drains out of him.
Elena clocks it. The relief in his face. Like a man who'd been holding his breath and finally got permission to stop.
She files it. Doesn't understand it.
"Contact," she says.
Tink-tink-tink. Impacts walking across the hull.
Three technicals emerge from behind a collapsed water tower—jury-rigged with scrap armor and ballistic mounts, engines screaming through the mud. Someone tipped them off. Someone knew they'd be riding the bones.
Elena kills the headlights and punches the accelerator. The skids scream, gripping buried metal harder. The Rover surges.
"Stay down," she tells Standard.
Standard doesn't move. Her hands remain folded.
The first technical pulls alongside. The driver—young, bandanna over his face—matches speed, trying for a clean angle.
Elena pops the roof hatch and flows upward, landing in a crouch. Rain hits her face like needles.
She performs a bunker-slide across the wet roof, using the Rover's momentum. Mid-slide, she fires—not at the driver, at the rusted support cables hanging from the overpass.
The cables snap. They lash across the technical's cab like steel razors. The vehicle spins, clips a barrier, rolls into the sinkhole.
Second technical. The shooter in the bed swings a mounted gun toward her.
Elena drops into the mud. A scavenger lunges with a pry-bar. She doesn't block—she pivots on the Rover's tire, using the vehicle's tilt for torque. Catches the bar mid-swing. Guides his momentum into the second attacker's chest.
He goes down choking.
Without looking, she puts a pulse through the first one's foot, pinning him. A high-arc kick drives his head into the steel pillar.
The third scavenger fires.
Heat sears across her left thigh. Ballistic graze—deep, burning. Her leg goes dead for three seconds.
She doesn't scream. She narrows her eyes and drops him with a burst to the sternum.
The remaining scavengers throw a grapnel-chain, hooking the Rover's rail. Elena slams her palm onto the exterior induction manifold and redlines the skids.
The mud trembles. Buried rails surge with magnetic pull. The chain retracts with such force that the scavengers are ripped off their feet and slammed into the hull.
They slide into the mud and don't move.
Elena drops through the hatch. Her thigh is soaked. Her right pinky bends wrong. She braces it against the wheel, pops it back. The pain is white and brief.
She looks at Standard.
The woman hasn't moved. Hands still folded. The ghost of muzzle flashes plays across her dark eyes.
"You didn't help," Elena says.
"You didn't need help."
Elena doesn't know if that's true. Doesn't know if that's the point.
The fusion gauge blinks: 14%. 13%. 12%.
On the horizon, yellow light. Jaundiced, weak, but steady. The compound's perimeter searchlights cutting through rain.
"There," Elena says.
Standard looks at the lights. Then at Hendricks.
The old man is unconscious again. Or pretending. His hand rests on his coat, over the revolver's weight.
Six chambers. Three spent at the stairs. Two remaining.
One round unaccounted for.
And when the bullets started flying, he was relieved.
Standard files this alongside what she knows: the missing round, the relief, the way he carries the weight like a promise he hasn't kept yet. She doesn't have a framework for what it means. But the pieces are accumulating.
She watches the blood spreading on Elena's fatigues. She watches the yellow lights grow brighter through the rain.
She is learning that silence is expensive.
And everyone pays for it in blood.
