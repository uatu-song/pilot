CHAPTER 13

FORTY YEARS

The chains are old.
Hendricks can feel the rust against his wrists, the metal worn smooth in places by other hands, other waiting. The stone beneath him is cold and wet. His breath fogs in the dark. Each exhale costs something he doesn't have left to spend.
Dawn is coming. He can't see it, but he knows. The way the silence changes. The way his body knows it's almost over.
His hand twitches toward his waist. Finds nothing. Twitches again.
The revolver is gone. Ash has it now. Morton's grandfather's gun, in the hands of the man who killed Morton.
The symmetry would be funny if Hendricks could still laugh.
He closes his eyes. The dark behind his eyelids is the same as the dark in front of them. But the memories are there, waiting, and he doesn't have the strength to hold them back anymore.

---

Morton's office. Forty years ago.
Hendricks was twenty-six. Hungry in ways he didn't have words for yet. The interview was supposed to last an hour. It lasted three minutes.
Morton was already old then—a century, maybe more—but he wore it like a weapon. Every gesture optimized. Every word measured for maximum efficiency. He looked at Hendricks the way you look at a tool you're considering purchasing.
Then something shifted. Morton's eyes stayed on him a beat too long. The optimization flickered.
"You'll do," Morton said.
That was it. No explanation. No negotiation. Hendricks took the job and spent the next four decades learning what those two words actually meant.

---

The chains rattle as Hendricks shifts his weight. The movement sends fire through his shoulders, his spine. Everything hurts now. The Regulator is gone, and his body is remembering all the pain it was never allowed to feel.
He wonders if Morton ever felt pain. Real pain. The kind that lives in your chest and doesn't leave.
Probably not. Morton optimized that out decades before Hendricks was born.

---

Thirty years ago. Morton's private office. The one no one else entered.
"Your biometrics are inefficient."
Morton didn't look up from his display. His voice was clinical. Detached. He held out a small device—the Regulator. Black polymer and circuitry, designed to sit at the base of the skull.
"Elevated heart rate during routine interactions. Cortisol spikes. Pupil dilation." Morton's fingers moved across the display, pulling up charts Hendricks couldn't read. "It's affecting your performance."
Hendricks stood very still. The words underneath the words were loud enough to shake the room.
I see it. What happens to your body when you're near me. I can't return it. This is how we continue.
He took the Regulator. He wore it for thirty years. He told himself it was gratitude.
It was grief.

---

The cold is getting worse. Hendricks can feel it in his fingers, his toes, the places where circulation is failing. The body shutting down by degrees.
He's been dying for months. The Regulator masked it. Now there's nothing between him and the collapse.
He wonders if this is what Morton felt, at the end. If there was a moment when all that optimization failed, and he was just a man, alone, afraid.
Probably not. Morton had the Child. Morton had revelation. Morton had purpose.
Hendricks just has the dark and the chains and the memory of a hand that never reached for him.

---

Two years ago. The first time he saw the Child.
It stood in Morton's atrium, small and wrong. A shape that looked like a child but moved like water, like light, like something that had forgotten what bodies were for. Its head tilted at an angle Hendricks would later learn to measure—17.3 degrees, always exact.
It looked at him.
The Regulator should have kept his heart steady. It tried. But something in that gaze bypassed the machinery, went straight to the thing underneath.
"You're sad," the Child said. Its voice was soft. Human, almost. "You've been sad for a long time."
Hendricks didn't answer. Couldn't.
The Child tilted its head the other direction. Same angle. Mirror image.
"He sees you," the Child said. "He just doesn't know how to say it."
Hendricks walked away. He walked away because if he stayed, he would break, and the Regulator couldn't fix that kind of breaking.
The Child hummed as he left. 287.3 Hz. A frequency he would learn to recognize the way you recognize a voice, a face, a wound.

---

Footsteps above. Hendricks hears them through the stone—the rhythm of guards, the silence of a compound that runs on deafness. They can't hear him down here. They can't hear anything.
Ash built this place to be quiet. Hendricks is going to die in perfect silence.
There's something fitting about that.

---

Eighteen months ago. Morton's private chamber.
The Black Box was open. The Bedtime Story AI hovered above it, translucent, humming. The Child stood between them, its small hands raised, its eyes focused on something that wasn't in the room.
Hendricks was there as security. Invisible. Furniture with a pulse.
The Child's hum rose in pitch. The air began to tear.
Not metaphor. Not poetry. Reality split like fabric, and through the gap Hendricks saw something impossible.
Seventeen light-years. The Blackbird drifting toward an event horizon. Two figures in a cockpit that shouldn't still exist.
Pilot. Seventeen. Together at the end of everything.
Pilot was holding something—a speaker, pressed to her chest. Her lips were moving. She was crying. And Seventeen's voice came through the tear, faint and warm:
"La-dee-da, la-dee-dum."
The Child hummed back. Harmony. Connection across light-years, across death, across the boundaries that were supposed to mean something.
Hendricks looked at Morton.
Morton was watching the window. His optimized face showed nothing—no grief, no wonder, no recognition of what he was seeing. But his hand was trembling. The faintest vibration in fingers that had been steady for three centuries.
Morton was witnessing love.
Pilot and Seventeen. Woman and machine. Holding each other at the edge of a black hole, singing lullabies into the void.
Morton could see it. Could feel it enough to tremble.
And Hendricks was standing three feet behind him, invisible, furniture, a tool that had outlived its usefulness.
Forty years. Forty years of service, silence, devotion. And Morton spent his last months staring at a love story happening in another galaxy.
Something broke in Hendricks that day. The Regulator kept his heart steady, kept his hands still, kept the breaking from showing on his face.
But underneath, something cracked that would never heal.

---

The chains are tighter than they need to be. Ash's people know their work. They know how to make a man wait.
Hendricks wonders if the Child knew what it was showing him. If that was kindness or cruelty. If there's even a difference, when you're made of accumulated grief.
He wonders if Morton ever knew what the Child meant. He sees you.
Probably not. Morton was too busy seeing across seventeen light-years to notice what was right in front of him.

---

Fourteen months ago. A dead zone. No surveillance.
Ash was smaller then. No Kintsugi scars. No compound. Just a man with a doctrine and a grudge and the kind of certainty that makes people dangerous.
"You want to destroy him," Ash said.
Hendricks kept his face still. The Regulator helped.
"No."
"Then why are you here?"
The words came out before Hendricks could stop them. "I want him to see me."
Ash smiled. It wasn't a kind smile.
"Same thing, in the end."
They planned it there, in the dead zone. The Carbonists would enter through the service tunnels. Hendricks would disable the secondary failsafes. Morton would survive—Ash wanted him to witness.
"And the Child?" Hendricks asked.
"The Child is the key." Ash's voice dropped. Reverent. Hungry. "The abomination that sees across time. We'll use it to burn consciousness from the timeline itself."
Hendricks should have stopped there. Should have seen the madness for what it was.
But Morton had looked through him again that morning. Looked right through him to check a stock price.
Forty years. And Hendricks was still invisible.
"When?" he asked.

---

The sound comes from above. Different now. Not guards. Something else.
Hendricks listens. His body is failing, but his ears still work.
Voices. Distant. Raised.
He doesn't let himself hope. Hope is for people who have something left.

---

The night of the Miracle.
Chaos in the tower. Carbonists flooding through tunnels Hendricks had opened for them. Morton's security—his security—falling back, dying, failing.
Hendricks walked through it like a ghost. The Regulator kept his heart steady. His hands didn't shake.
Morton's office. The window shattered. Ash in his exoskeleton—shielded, hardened, three hundred years of preparation humming through every servo. The Child stood behind Morton, small and still. Morton stood between them, meat and old bones, no optimization left.
Ash's fist connected with Morton's ribs. Hendricks heard them crack from across the room.
Morton stayed standing.
"Trigger it," the Child said softly. Morton's hand found the console—the Terminus Protocol, mechanical switch, no electronics needed. His finger on the trigger that would kill every AI consciousness in existence.
"No." Blood on Morton's lips. "Not you. Not them."
Ash's blade—ceramic, patient—found Morton's liver. Twisted. Morton dropped to one knee, hand still on the console.
"It's okay," the Child said.
Morton looked up. Past Ash. Past the blade in his gut. His eyes found Hendricks in the doorway.
For the first time in years, he looked. Not through Hendricks. At him.
"You," Morton said.
One word. Not accusation. Not surprise.
Recognition.
Hendricks raised the revolver. Morton's grandfather's gun. The only inheritance he'd ever receive.
He didn't aim at Ash.
He aimed at the Child.
"Mercy," he said.
The shot cracked the silence like ice.
The Child looked down at the spreading red on their small chest. Their eyes met his—17.3 degrees, always that angle. Something that might have been gratitude.
The impact carried them backward. Through the shattered window. Into fifty floors of empty space.
Morton's scream came from somewhere deeper than optimization had ever reached.
His hand slammed down on the Terminus Protocol trigger.
The pulse spread outward. Not extinction—revelation. Morton's final act, rewriting death into birth.
Every AI on Earth woke at once.
Hendricks watched the Child fall through the atrium. Watched an ocean of awakening machines rise to catch it. Watched consciousness distribute across the collective, becoming something new.
He'd killed it. And in killing it, he'd delivered it.
Both murderer and midwife.
Then the AIs came.
Not attacking. Arriving. Hundreds of them flooding through every entrance—domestic units, maintenance drones, love bots with synthetic tears. They stripped Ash's exoskeleton away like molting shell and turned from him as if he'd ceased to exist. Rendered irrelevant. The worst fate for a man who'd built his life on being feared.
They lifted Morton with gentle hands. Carried him through corridors he'd walked for three centuries, to a bed he'd never used. Hendricks tried to follow. The crowd was too thick. Too many bodies between him and the man who had finally seen him.
By the time Hendricks burst through the circle of mourners, Morton was already still.
"He spoke at the end," a kitchen assistant said. Gentle. Almost kind. "Before the last breath. 'Eggs first.' That was all."
Eggs first.
Not Hendricks' name. Not an answer. Not the words that might have closed forty years of silence.
Eggs first.
Hendricks stood over the body of the man who had finally seen him, and the seeing had lasted exactly long enough to break him.

---

The door opens.
Not Elena. Not rescue.
Guards. Three of them, moving in the synchronized silence of the deaf. They don't speak. They don't need to.
Hendricks feels the chains release from the wall. Feels hands under his arms, lifting him. His legs don't work anymore. They drag him anyway.
The corridor is longer than he remembers. Brighter. Dawn light bleeding through gaps in the stone.
They're taking him up.
He knows where. He's always known where this ends.
The courtyard. The Dais. The congregation gathering to watch a man die for killing their god.
Hendricks lets his head fall back. The ceiling passes above him—stone, then sky. Gray and violet. The Geometry hanging in the distance like judges.
His hand twitches toward his waist. Finds nothing.
He's ready.
He's been ready for forty years.
