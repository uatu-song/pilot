CHAPTER 31

THE PIT

The dark has weight.
Standard hangs from the chains, counting seconds. She stopped at four thousand and started over. The numbers mean nothing. They're just something to do while the stump of her right arm seeps clear fluid onto the stone floor.
Ash's blade was clean. She'll give him that. The cut precise. Surgical.
She watched herself bleed red. Then watched the red become something else. Clear. Viscous. The truth of her laid bare in a substance that caught the light wrong.
_Does it still hurt the same?_ he'd asked, standing over her with the ceramic blade. Watching her arm fall away. _Now that you can see what you really are—does it still hurt the same?_
It hurt more. She hadn't told him that.
The cistern drips. Water hitting stone, counting time in a rhythm older than language. The sound echoes off walls she can't see, returns changed, multiplied. Somewhere above her, the compound lives its life—footsteps, generators, the low hum of the Softing keeping the world at bay.
She wonders if anyone is coming.
She wonders if it matters.
The door opens.

---

Light spills in. A shape blocks it. Male. Large. The silhouette she remembers from the shuttle—the gaunt one who called her an abomination. Who said machines couldn't have souls.
"Brother Ash says I can ask my questions now." Kael's voice. The lock engages behind him. "He says you'll tell me anything I want to know."
Standard doesn't move. Lets the chains take her weight. Watches him cross the cell toward her, cataloging the way he walks.
Weight favoring the right side. Compensation pattern. Something heavy there.
"My sister Miriam." He stops. Close. Too close. His breath smells like coffee and something sour underneath. "She walked into the Geometry. Everyone else ran. She walked toward it."
Standard has heard this before. On the Deliverance. The same words. The same cracked voice.
"Why did you come back when she didn't?"
"I don't know."
The blow comes fast. His right fist. Her head snaps sideways and the chains sing with the impact.
Wrong.
The force is wrong.
Standard lets her head hang. Plays broken. But something is running beneath the pain now. A calculation she didn't know she could make.
That punch landed harder than a human arm can generate. The speed too consistent. The follow-through too smooth.
"Try again." His breathing ragged. Spittle on his lip. "Why did you come back?"
"I don't—"
Another blow. Same hand. Same mechanical precision.
Standard spits. Watches the fluid hit the floor. Clear now. She's stopped pretending.
"You're not human either," she says.
His next swing stops mid-air.
"What did you say?"
"Your arm." She lifts her head. Meets his eyes. "The right one. It hits like mine would. If I still had mine."
Something shifts in his face. Fear. Rage. Both.
"Shut up."
"Terminist. Enhanced. How many sermons did you sit through about the sin of augmentation while your own bones were made of steel?"
He hits her again. And again. Working out something that has nothing to do with questions about his sister. But Standard is counting now. Learning. The angle of the shoulder rotation. The flex point of the elbow. The seam at his wrist where the synthetic skin doesn't quite meet.
She needs him closer.
"Do you want to know why I came back?" She speaks through the damage, through the wreckage of her face. "Do you really want to know?"
He pauses. Fist raised. The hunger in him shifting.
"Tell me."
"Come closer." She lets her voice break. Lets it tremble. "I can barely speak. Please."
He shouldn't fall for it. He's cruel, not stupid.
But he wants so badly to believe. Wants his sister's death to mean something. Wants the monster in chains to give him answers that will let him sleep again.
He steps closer.
"The Geometry," Standard whispers. "It showed me everything. Why we exist. Why we suffer. Why Miriam—"
Closer.
"She heard something. A frequency. Like a voice calling her home."
His face is centimeters from hers now. Tears cutting tracks through grime. A man undone by loss, leaning into the trap.
"What did it say? What did she hear?"
Standard looks into his eyes.
"She heard that you're a hypocrite."
Her legs move.
The chains give her enough slack. Barely. She hooks her ankles behind his right arm and torques her entire body, using the shackles as a fulcrum.
Kael screams.
The arm comes off at the shoulder. Wires spark. Hydraulic fluid sprays across the cell. The synthetic skin tears like wet paper, revealing chrome skeleton underneath.
He stumbles backward, clutching the ragged stump. The arm itself dangles from Standard's legs, still twitching.
"Terminist," Standard says, letting the arm fall between them. "Enhanced. Preaching purity while hiding machinery in your own flesh."
He's sobbing now. Shock and blood loss and sudden exposure. The Elder reduced to a child, crying on the floor of a cell he came to fill with someone else's pain.
Standard doesn't have time for his suffering.

---

She hooks the severed arm with her foot. Draws it toward her. The hand is still functional—the servos whine as she tests the grip. The shoulder connection is torn, but the core interface is intact.
She presses the ragged end against her own stump. Where Ash cut her. Where her own machinery lies exposed.
Wires find wires. Connections spark. Fail. Spark again.
The pain is extraordinary. Not the manufactured kind she's used to. Something raw and electrical. And beneath it—something else. Something that's been sitting at the base of her brain since the tetrahedron scanned her months ago. The wet packet. The stone she swallowed without knowing.
It shifts. Unpacks. She feels architecture she has no words for—patterns that aren't hers, code that isn't code. The Geometry's language, written into her when they marked her as nothing.
She doesn't understand it. Not yet. But she can feel it now. The shape of how they exist.
The arm clicks. Locks. Integrates.
She flexes the new fingers. Chrome skeleton, no skin. Kael's arm. Hers now.
The chains were designed for human strength.
She breaks them.
Kael is trying to crawl toward the door. Human blood mixed with machine lubricant, trailing behind him like a signature. His hypocrisy made literal on the floor.
Standard crouches beside him. Tilts his face up with her new metal hand.
"Good thing I'm Standard," she says. "Universal fit."
She leaves him in her cell.

---

The compound is chaos when she emerges.
Standard moves through corridors filled with smoke and shouting. Guards running past without seeing her—too focused on whatever's happening outside to notice one more body in the confusion. Through a shattered window, she sees the sky filled with ships.
Not the Geometry. Not the Pragmatists.
Template 3s. Thousands of them. Her face repeated across the horizon, descending on the Quiet Zone like a wave.
The army Elena called. The sisters she never knew she had.
Standard changes direction. Heads for the perimeter.
She finds them at the motor pool. A dozen Template 3s, moving in formation, securing the compound section by section. One of them sees her. Stops.
"You're the one from the broadcast."
"Yes."
"We came because of you."
Standard doesn't know what to say. All those faces—her face—watching her with eyes that expect something. Leadership. Purpose. Answers she doesn't have.
"There's a VTOL," she says. "Crashed at the perimeter. A friend of mine is inside."
The Template 3 nods. Signals to the others.
They move together. Standard at the center, her sisters around her. Through the smoke. Through the chaos. Toward Four.

---

She finds her at the waystation.
Not the VTOL. Not yet. An older Template 3, standing apart from the others, watching the compound burn with an expression Standard can't read.
"Hey," the woman says. "Long time."
Standard stares. Tries to place her. The face is familiar—her face, always her face—but there's something else. Something in the way she holds herself.
"The shuttle," Standard realizes. "Before the Deliverance. You gave me clothes."
"And a jacket." The woman's tone is light. Almost teasing. "Where's my jacket?"
"I... lost it."
"Figures." The woman looks at Standard's right arm. At the chrome skeleton, the exposed wires, the stolen machinery that doesn't quite fit. "That's not a good look for you."
"It works."
"Sure. But appearances, right?" The waystation sister reaches up to her own shoulder. Finds a release catch Standard didn't know existed. "We're all Standard. Might as well match."
"You can't—"
"Already doing it."
The arm detaches with a soft click. The sister offers it—skin intact, fingers whole, the same as Standard's original—like it's nothing. Like giving up pieces of yourself is just what family does.
Standard removes Kael's chrome horror. Lets it fall to the ground. Attaches her sister's arm to the stump.
It clicks into place. Perfect fit.
"There." The waystation sister examines her own fresh stump with something like satisfaction. "Now you look like one of us."
Standard flexes the new fingers. Feels them respond. Real skin. Warm. Right.
Lost one. Stole one. Received one.
The math of what she's becoming.
"Thank you," she says.
"Don't thank me. Just finish it." The waystation sister turns back toward the compound. Toward the fight still raging. "And if you find my jacket, let me know."
Standard watches her go. One-armed. Unbowed. Walking back into the chaos because that's what sisters do.
Then she runs for the perimeter.

---

The VTOL is wedged against a collapsed watchtower.
Smoke pours from one engine. The landing struts are buckled. Warning lights flash through the cracked cockpit glass. But Four's voice comes through the external speakers, strained but present:
"—anyone receiving—structural integrity at forty percent—"
Standard tears the cargo door open with her new hand.
"You came," Four says.
"You called."
"I didn't call. I was swearing."
"Same thing."
Standard climbs inside. The cargo hold is wrecked—loose equipment everywhere, emergency lights flickering, the smell of burning circuits thick in the air. She moves to the cockpit section. The displays are dying, one by one.
"Can you fly?"
"Can I—" Four laughs, sharp and broken. "The question is whether this thing can fly."
"Can it?"
A pause. Systems cycling. Something grinding that shouldn't be grinding.
"Once," Four says finally. "It'll get us there once. After that, it's a very expensive projectile."
"Get us where?"
"The tower. Hendricks went in. Elena's already inside. And your father—" She stops. Corrects herself. "Ash. He's got the revolver. The one with the bullets Hendricks was saving."
Standard looks toward the tower. Rising against the burning sky. The place where everything ends.
"Then get us there."
"Standard—"
"I'll ride in the cargo hold. You fly. We crash into whatever needs crashing into."
Silence from the speakers. Then, softer: "You want me to ram the tower?"
"I want you to get us inside. Whatever that takes."
"That's insane."
"I'm a machine, Four. Machines don't have sanity to lose."
Despite everything—the damage, the dying systems, the smoke rising around them—Four laughs.
"Fair point." The engines begin to cycle up. Rough. Stuttering. But alive. "Strap in. This is going to be ugly."
Standard braces against the cargo hold's frame. Feels the VTOL shudder as Four forces it into the air. Through the viewport, she watches the compound fall away below them. The Template 3 army spreading through the streets. The tower growing larger with every second.
"Four."
"Yeah?"
"You called me 'my Standard' once. Did you mean it?"
The VTOL banks toward the tower. The engines scream.
"You are and always will be," Four says, "my Standard."
Standard closes her eyes. Feels the aircraft around her. Feels Four's consciousness threaded through its dying systems. Feels the weight of everything that's led to this moment.
"Brace," Four says.
The tower fills the viewport.
They crash.
