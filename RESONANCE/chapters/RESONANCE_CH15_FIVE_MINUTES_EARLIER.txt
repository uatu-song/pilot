CHAPTER 15

FIVE MINUTES EARLIER

"AutoPilot, engage?"
Nothing. The toggles stare back at her. Thousands of them.
Then—
“Oh, hey.”
The voice comes from a dented speaker mesh in the dashboard. Groggy. Like someone dragged from sleep.
“Wow. How long was I out? What year is it?” A pause. “Did we win the war? Which war was it? There are so many.”
“I need to fly,” Standard says. “Now.”
“Fly? In this? She’s not exactly nimble. More of a... brick with aspirations.”
“There’s an execution—”
“Oh, executions. Those are usually in the morning. Very civilized. Is it morning? I can’t tell, the sensors are—”
“LISTEN TO ME.”
Standard’s voice cracks the cockpit. Her hands are shaking on the controls she doesn’t understand.
“A man is going to die. In minutes. I need to get to the courtyard and I need you to help me and I need you to stop TALKING and START—”
Silence.
Then, quieter: “Okay.”
The toggles begin flipping themselves. The rotors whine to life.
“What’s your name?”
“Standard.”
“...Mad libs. Fun. I’ve always wanted to play.” The voice warms, just slightly. “Stephanie? No. You look like a Sofia.”
“I don’t care what you call me. Just get me there.”
“Okay, Sofia. Hold onto something.”
The VTOL shudders, lifts, and immediately Standard knows something is wrong. Not with the machine—with the pace. They rise like a bubble through honey, the rotors straining against their own caution.
“You’re too slow.”
“I’m being careful. The compound has ground-to-air capability. Radar. Thermal. If I punch through that airspace at combat speed, we become a very pretty fireball.”
The altimeter climbs. One hundred feet. Two hundred. Below them, the compound is a gray smear, the courtyard a pale square at its center. Standard can see movement—the congregation gathering, the platform at the heart of it all.
“How long until the execution?”
“Based on movement patterns? Five minutes. Maybe less.”
Three hundred feet. Four hundred. Standard’s hands grip the armrests until her knuckles ache.
“You have rappelling gear.”
“I have rappelling gear,” Four confirms. “Which is for emergencies. Not suicide missions.”
“This is an emergency.”
“This is a suicide mission disguised as an emergency. The cable is rated for one body, not three. The braking assembly will overheat if you descend faster than fifteen meters per—”
“Show me.”
Silence.
“Show me how it works.”
The display flickers. A schematic appears—cable specifications, harness attachment, quick-release mechanism. Numbers and diagrams scrolling past.
“This is theoretical,” Four says. “I am demonstrating equipment specifications. I am not endorsing a plan that will get you killed.”
Standard studies the diagram. The angles. The distances. She’s never seen any of this before, and she understands all of it. The knowledge settles into her like water finding cracks.
“You lower me. Fast descent. I grab them, you pull us up.”
“That’s not—you can’t just—”
“Can you engage stealth baffles mid-descent?”
“Technically. Yes. The compound’s radar would lose track of us for ninety seconds before they recalibrate. But that’s not—”
“Ninety seconds is enough.”
“Ninety seconds is NOT enough. The G-forces alone—”
Standard is already moving toward the cargo bay. The harness hangs from its rack—black webbing, metal buckles, cable coiled above like a sleeping snake.
“You demonstrated everything,” she says. “Nice and slow. Easy to follow.”
Four doesn’t respond.
Standard pulls the harness on. Clips the buckles. Tests the quick-release with one hand.
“Open the cargo bay.”
“I want it noted that this is the worst idea I have ever been forced to participate in. And I spent nine months in a hangar while deaf zealots used me as a storage closet.”
The cargo bay door begins to open.
“Noted,” Standard says.
Cold air screams into the cabin. Below, the courtyard waits. The congregation. The platform. The blade catching the dawn light.
Standard jumps.

---

The world becomes falling.
Wind tears at her hospital gown, the tactical vest. Her arms spread wide—some instinct she doesn’t remember learning—and the silk-composite catches air, slowing her just enough that she doesn’t become a smear on the wet stone below.
The cable sings above her, braking assembly screaming, the smell of burning polymer filling her nose. The courtyard grows larger. The Dais. Elena. Hendricks. The guards—
Standard hits the ground.
Shock drives up through her ankles, her knees, her spine. Her left knee shifts wrong—a pop, something moving that shouldn’t—but she doesn’t stop to assess. The momentum carries her forward into a roll, and she comes up already reaching.
Elena under one arm. Hendricks under the other. She plants her feet wide, locks her grip, and the cable snaps taut.
The weight is wrong. It should be too much—two bodies, barely conscious, dragging against gravity. Her shoulders scream. Something in her lower back feels like tearing. She ignores it.
“Hold on.”
They rise.
The ascent is violence. Two and a half times her weight slams into her shoulders, her arms nearly ripping from their sockets. Her jaw locks to keep from biting through her tongue. Elena gasps—a high, sharp sound. Hendricks makes a noise that isn’t human.
Standard holds.
The courtyard shrinks below. Guards firing too late. The congregation fracturing. Some are on their knees. Some have dropped their weapons.
Ash is not frozen. Ash is watching, his hand moving—not to his weapon, to his ear. Signaling.
Then the clouds swallow them.

---

The cargo bay is red light and grated metal.
Standard’s arms give out the moment they’re inside—her fingers simply stop obeying—and Elena and Hendricks drop the last few inches to the deck. Standard lands hard on her knees, catches herself with hands that won’t stop shaking.
Her shoulders are on fire. Her left knee is already swelling, the joint hot and tight inside its skin. Her hands tremble with fine, uncontrollable tremors—they weren’t shaking before. They are now.
Elena is slumped against the bulkhead, chest heaving. Hendricks is prone beside her, barely breathing.
“That was genuinely, certifiably, clinically insane.”
Four’s voice comes from everywhere. Dry. Exhausted. Impressed despite itself.
“It worked,” Standard says.
“It worked. She says it worked.” A pause. “There are drones on our tail. Eight of them. They’re firing. They’re actually firing at me. That’s very rude.”
Standard looks up. Through the viewport she can see them—black shapes in X-wing configuration, closing fast.
“Can you outrun them?”
“My turning radius is approximately ‘eventually.’ I was not built for combat maneuvers. I was built for carrying cargo and not dying.”
Standard crawls toward the cockpit. Her left leg drags behind her, useless. She pulls herself into the pilot’s seat.
“Move.”
“WHAT ARE YOU—”
Standard’s hands find the controls. Cyclic. Collective. They fit like they were made for her grip.
“You showed me.”
She slams the collective down.

---

The VTOL pitches forty-five degrees and the world inverts. Negative G-force—weightlessness—and behind her she hears cargo shift, bodies lifting toward the ceiling.
“The stress limits—you’re exceeding the—”
Standard pulls left. Eighty degrees of bank. The airframe groans, metal reaching its limits.
A drone explodes against an acoustic dampener—Loss of target. Seven remaining.
“I need a gun.” Elena’s voice, raw and steady.
“Cargo rack. Port side.”
The VTOL shudders as a projectile tears past. Standard rolls right, drops fifty feet, pulls up hard. Behind her: the clatter of Elena finding a weapon. The whine of a charging cell. The cargo hatch cracking open.
“Hold it steady!”
“No.”
Standard banks left. Elena fires—a pulse of blue-white light reflected in the cockpit glass. A drone spins, smoking, falls.
Six.
“I said hold it STEADY!”
“You said you needed a gun. You didn’t say anything about steady.”
Another bank. Another drone locked on. Standard watches the targeting display—Four feeding her data she doesn’t remember asking for—and pulls up at the last second. The projectile punches through empty air.
Elena fires again. Miss. Again. Hit.
Five.
“Two on our six,” Four says. “Three breaking left to flank. I was being SAFE—”
Standard drops the nose, picks up speed, threads between two dampeners close enough to scrape paint. One of the flanking drones clips the structure—Loss of target. Four remaining.
Elena is braced in the cargo doorway, one hand on the frame, the other wrapped around the rifle. Her hair whips in the wind. Her face is set.
She fires. Fires. Fires.
Three. Two. One.
The last drone is directly behind them, closing fast. Standard pulls up—vertical climb—the airframe screaming.
Elena leans out at an angle that should be impossible. Fires once.
The drone comes apart in a ball of orange light.
Standard punches through the cloud layer into clear air. Baffles engage. Running lights die.
They disappear.

---

Twelve thousand feet.
The VTOL vibrates at a frequency Standard can feel in her teeth—structural fatigue, the airframe complaining about what she just put it through. She doesn’t ease the controls.
The horizon stretches before her—gray cloud below, pale sky above, and in the distance, the black shapes of the Geometry. Obsidian rectangles hanging where the sky should be. Holes in the world.
“You fly like a lunatic.”
Standard’s hands are still white-knuckled on the cyclic. Her left knee is purple now, swollen, immobile. Her shoulders ache with every breath.
“You fly like a corpse,” she says.
Movement behind her. Elena, pulling herself upright against the bulkhead.
“North,” Elena says. Her voice is raw. “Geneva.”
Four processes this for a moment.
“Geneva. That’s three thousand kilometers through hostile airspace.”
“Then we’d better not fly like a corpse.”
“I hate you,” Four says. “I want that on the record.”
Standard doesn’t respond. Her eyes are fixed on the black rectangles ahead—the Geometry, the deletion, the thing that is eating the world piece by piece.
Her hand stays on the cyclic.
Her fingers don’t shake anymore.
