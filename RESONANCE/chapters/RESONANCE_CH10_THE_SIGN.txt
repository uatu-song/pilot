**Chapter 10: The Sign**
**POV:** Standard
**Tense:** Present

Ash turns.
He looks at the Rover.
He looks at Standard.
She is still in the driver's seat.
She hasn't moved. She's been watching through the windshield — the reunion, the recognition, the violence — with the stillness of someone watching weather happen to other people.
Ash walks toward her.
His footsteps are the only sound. The guards are statues. The wind has stopped. Even the hum of the Box is gone now, carried into the tower.
He stops at her door. He doesn't open it. He just looks at her through the glass.
Standard looks back.
His eyes are gray. Not shifting. Not mystical. Just gray, like stone, like the walls, like everything in this place that has had the color bled out of it.
"Who is this?" Ash asks.
He's not asking Standard. He's asking Elena, who has come up behind him, breathless.
"She's—" Elena stops. Standard can see her thinking. See the calculation happening in real-time.
"She's the one who walked through the Drop," Elena says.
Ash tilts his head. "Walked through?"
"The frequency. At the checkpoint. It hit everyone — guards, refugees, everyone. They all went down. She didn't."
Ash's eyes narrow. He looks at Standard again. Longer this time.
"She's not wearing dampeners," he says.
"She doesn't need them."
"Everyone needs them. The noise is everywhere. It's in the air, the wires, the—"
"She's quiet," Elena says. "Father. She's quiet the way you talk about. The old texts — the ones that describe the Silence before the Signal. She's like that. The drones scanned her and they left her alone. The frequency weapons hit her and she kept walking. She's—"
Elena swallows. Standard can see her building it. Brick by brick. The armor.
"She's a sign," Elena says. "I don't know what she is, but she's not noise. She's not Signal. She's something else."
Ash is silent for a long moment.
Then he opens the door.
Standard doesn't move. She sits there, hands on her lap, looking up at the man who runs this place. The man who hates everything she might be.
"Get out," Ash says.
Standard gets out.
She stands in the courtyard, the cold violet light washing over her, and she waits. She's good at waiting. It's the only thing she's sure she knows how to do.
Ash circles her.
He moves slowly, examining her the way you examine livestock. He looks at her ruined hands. Her borrowed clothes. The name stitched on her shirt.
He stops.
"Otis," he reads. He looks at Elena. "This is Otis's shirt."
"Otis is dead," Elena says. "She died for the Box."
"And this one is wearing her skin." Ash's voice is flat. "Wearing the clothes of my dead soldier. Walking through frequencies that kill. Standing in my courtyard like she belongs here."
He turns back to Standard.
"What are you?" he asks.
Standard considers the question. She doesn't know the answer. She hasn't known the answer since the apartment, since the box, since the word that echoed in the dark.
"Standard," she says.
"That's a name. I asked what you are."
"I don't know."
Ash stares at her. He's looking for the lie. The calculation. The angle.
He doesn't find it.
"She's telling the truth," he murmurs. He sounds almost disappointed. "She doesn't know."
He turns to Elena.
"Your 'sign' is a broken thing," he says. "A glitch in the machinery of the world. She doesn't know what she is because she isn't anything. She's an error. A leftover."
"Then why did the drones spare her?" Elena asks. "Why did the frequency—"
"I don't know." Ash cuts her off. "And that's the problem."
He gestures to two guards. They step forward. They take Standard's arms — one on each side, firm but not violent.
"Take her to the Examination Room," Ash says. "Strip her. Scan her. Find out what's under the skin."
"Father—"
"You brought me a box of ghosts and a woman who might be one," Ash says. "You brought me Morton's executioner. You brought me questions, Elena. I need answers."
He turns and walks toward the tower.
"Wait," Elena says. She's following him, practically running to keep up. "The Box — the upload — we need to integrate the data before—"
"The Box can wait," Ash says. "It's been waiting for years. A few more hours won't matter."
"But the sky — the things in the sky — they're coming—"
Ash stops. He turns.
"The things in the sky," he says, flat. "Is that what you're calling them?"
"The ones who dropped the frequency. They're — Father, they're clearing the land. They're formatting everything. We saw a settlement on the way — everyone was gone. Just... erased. And their houses were lit up like they were waiting for new—"
"I know," Ash says.
Elena stops.
"You know?"
"I've known for six hours," Ash says. "Since the first transmission came through." He gestures at the tower. "We have listeners. Interpreters. Men and women who have trained for years to hear the shape of silence. They caught the pattern. They decoded the message."
He smiles. It is not a warm smile.
"What's coming has always been coming," he says. "This is what I built the Quiet Zone for, Elena. Not to hide from the noise. To be ready for the silence."
He turns and walks into the tower.
The doors close behind him.
Standard stands in the courtyard.
The guards hold her arms. They are waiting for someone to tell them where to go. They cannot hear. They can only see.
Elena stands alone, staring at the tower, at the doors that closed in her face. She looks lost. Young. All the armor she built — for herself, for Standard — crumbling.
"The Examination Room," one of the guards says. He must be reading lips, or following a script. "This way."
They turn Standard toward one of the low buildings. The one without windows.
Standard goes.
She doesn't fight. She doesn't speak. She walks between the guards, through the silent courtyard, past the men and women who cannot hear her footsteps, toward a door that opens into darkness.
Before she crosses the threshold, she looks back.
Elena is still standing there. She hasn't moved.
Their eyes meet.
Standard doesn't know what her face is doing. She doesn't know how to send a message with a look. But she tries. She tries to say: I understand. You tried. It wasn't enough.
Then the door closes.
And the silence swallows her whole.
