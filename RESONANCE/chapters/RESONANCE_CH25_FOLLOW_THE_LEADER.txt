CHAPTER 25

FOLLOW THE LEADER

A hand closes around her throat.
Her fingers are still reaching for the other restraint, still brushing the clasp, almost there — and then she isn't reaching anymore. She's being dragged.
Kael.
His face is wild. The grief cracked open now, the rage pouring through. Half the chamber is gone — consumed by perfect planes, by angles that shouldn't exist — and his delegation with it. But he's still here. He survived. And he's not running.
"You don't get to escape," he says. His voice is barely human. "You don't get to walk away."
The restraints on her ankles tear free as the frame buckles — not her strength, just cheap metal failing under stress. He hauls her toward a side door, one the Geometry hasn't reached yet.
Standard fights. Claws at his arm with her free hand. But her right wrist is still locked in the broken restraint, the metal biting into her skin, and her shoulder is torn from pulling, and he's stronger than he looks. Stronger than grief should allow.
"Miriam walked into that thing." He's not talking to her. He's talking to himself. To the absence where his sister used to be. "She walked in and she didn't come back. But you — you walk through it like it's nothing. Like it's yours."
The side door opens. A corridor, still intact. Emergency lighting, red and stuttering.
Standard tries to plant her feet. The floor is slick — condensation, or something worse — and she can't find purchase. Her heel catches on a seam, holds for half a second, and then he yanks and she's moving again.
"If the Geometry wants you," he says, "then I'm going to find out why."
Behind them, the door seals. Through the small viewport, Standard watches the Council chamber collapse into perfect, terrible planes. The space where she stood is untouched. A gap in the pattern that's eating the world.
Then Kael pulls her around a corner and the viewport is gone.

---

The corridors blur.
Red light. Gray walls. The distant sound of alarms she can hear through the metal but not through the air — the ship screaming in frequencies she can't name. Kael moves fast, navigating by memory or instinct, and Standard can do nothing but be dragged.
Her throat aches where his hand was. Her shoulder screams. The broken restraint on her right wrist clanks against the floor with every step, a chain she can't shed.
They pass bodies. Crew members who didn't make it to the escape pods. Some of them are still human-shaped. Some of them are perfect.
Kael doesn't look at them.
"Thirty years," he mutters. "Thirty years I've hunted your kind. Every template, every configuration, every abomination that crawled out of Morton's factories." His grip tightens on her arm. "I've seen them beg. I've seen them bargain. I've seen them try to simulate faith."
He stops at a junction. Checks both directions. Chooses left.
"None of them walked through the sky and came out the other side."
They reach a hangar. Smaller than the main bay — a service dock, maybe, or emergency egress. A single shuttle sits on the pad, Terminist markings on the hull. Two men in gray fatigues are prepping it for launch. They see Kael and snap to attention.
"Bishop. We thought you were—"
"Get us in the air." Kael shoves Standard toward the ramp. "Now."
The men don't ask questions. They don't look at her too closely. They just move.
Standard stumbles up the ramp. Her knees hit the deck — cold metal, vibrating with engine warmup. The shuttle is cramped, built for speed rather than comfort. Kael pushes her into a corner and binds her wrists together with a length of cable. The broken restraint is still attached to her right arm. He doesn't bother removing it.
"You're making a mistake," Standard says.
Kael crouches in front of her. His face is close enough that she can see the burst capillaries in his eyes, the grief carved into every line.
"Miriam had red hair," he says. "Did I tell you that? Red hair and three children and a laugh that could fill a room." His voice cracks. "She walked into the Geometry looking for them. Her babies. The first wave took them while she was at work. She spent six months trying to find a way in. And then she found one."
Standard says nothing.
"She didn't come back." He stands. Turns away. "But you did. You and your 'father' and your little disciple. You walked through and you came back, and I want to know why. I want to know what makes you different. I want to know—"
He stops. His shoulders shake.
"I want to know if she's still in there. Somewhere. If the Geometry keeps what it takes, or if it just... deletes."
The shuttle lifts. Standard feels the acceleration press her against the bulkhead. Through the small viewport, she watches the Deliverance shrink — a massive shape being eaten from the inside, the Geometry spreading through its corridors like frost across glass.
Elena is still on that ship. Hendricks. Four.
Standard closes her eyes.
I know who holds my leash.
The cable bites into her wrists. The hum in her chest is quiet. Patient. Waiting for something she can't name.
She is cargo again.
But cargo can be recovered.

---

The cell is small. The cell is dark. The cell is shaking.
Elena counts the impacts through the wall. Three in the last minute. Each one closer than the last. Each one followed by that absence of sound — the silence that has weight, that presses against the ears like pressure underwater.
She doesn't know how long she's been here. Minutes. Hours. Time moves wrong in the dark, in the shaking, in the waiting. Her hands are bound in front of her — magnetic cuffs, standard Sovereignty issue — and the implant at the base of her skull is humming with a frequency that wasn't there before. Dante's frequency. Pointing somewhere she can't reach.
Another impact. The lights flicker. Die. Come back wrong — red now, emergency red, the color of endings.
"Elena."
The voice comes from the vent. Small. Tinny. Familiar.
"Four?"
"The sanitation drone was the only thing small enough to fit through the ducts." A pause. "I'm going to be honest. This is deeply undignified."
Elena almost laughs. It comes out as a cough.
"The Geometry is formatting Deck 7," Four continues. "The Council chamber is compromised. I'm reading massive structural failure across the port quarter."
"Standard—"
"I don't know. I can't reach her signal. Either she's shielded, or—"
"Don't say it."
"I wasn't going to." The vent cover rattles. Small legs appear — the drone, ridiculous and tiny, dropping to the floor of her cell. "I have good news and bad news."
"Good news first."
"Dante's codes work. I can release the locks."
"And the bad news?"
"The ship is dying. We have maybe fifteen minutes before the Geometry reaches this deck. And I have no idea where Standard is."
The magnetic cuffs click. Fall away.
Elena stands. Her legs shake — exhaustion, fear, the aftermath of whatever they pumped into her to keep her docile. She ignores it.
"Hendricks?"
"Next cell. Already moving."
She pushes through the door. The corridor is chaos — red light, shaking walls, crew members running past without seeing her. Hendricks is stumbling out of the adjacent cell, his face gray but his eyes sharp.
"Where?" he asks.
"Council chamber. That's where they had her."
"No." Four's voice, from a speaker overhead. "The VTOL. Main hangar. I'm still in her."
"Standard—"
"Is gone, Elena. The Terminist shuttle launched two minutes ago. Trajectory heading south-southeast. The Quiet Zone."
Hendricks' face goes still. "He's taking her to Ash."
"We have to go after her."
"We will. But first we have to not die." Four's voice crackles. "Main hangar. Dante's meeting us there. Move."
They run.

---

The corridors unmake themselves behind them.
Elena doesn't look back. She learned that in the tower, in NED, in every firefight she's survived: you don't look at what's chasing you. You look at where you're going.
But she can hear it. The sound that isn't sound — the silence eating through metal and flesh and everything else. Getting closer.
Four navigates through the speakers, her voice jumping from panel to panel as they pass. "Left at the junction. Straight through the cargo bay. The hangar's three hundred meters."
"Is it still there?" Hendricks asks between breaths.
"For now."
They round a corner and nearly collide with Dante.
He's armed — a pulse rifle that looks too big for him, stolen from somewhere. His face is pale but set. He sees Elena, and something in his shoulders relaxes.
"I thought—" he starts.
"Later." Elena grabs his arm, pulls him with them. "Move."
They move.
The main hangar is chaos. Crew members fighting for escape pods. Officers trying to maintain order and failing. Smoke pouring from a ruptured fuel line. And in the far corner, untouched by the panic, the VTOL sits waiting.
Four's voice comes from everywhere now. "Get in. Strap down. This is going to be ugly."
Elena hauls herself up the ramp. Hendricks follows, then Dante. The cargo bay is exactly as they left it — supply crates, webbing, the faint smell of recycled air.
"Where's the pilot?" Dante asks.
"You're looking at her." The ramp seals. The engines whine to life. "I'm the pilot. I'm the copilot. I'm the navigation system and the weapons array and the emergency rations."
"You can fly us out of this?"
"I can fly us out of anything." A pause. "Someone taught me that."
The VTOL lifts. And immediately banks hard left.
Elena grabs a handhold as the world tilts. Through the cargo bay window, she sees the hangar doors rushing toward them — and beyond them, black shapes in the sky. The Geometry, spreading across the Deliverance's hull like frost.
"Four—"
"Hold on."
The VTOL drops. Negative G — Elena's stomach lurches into her throat. They're diving, threading between escape pods and debris, the hangar ceiling rushing past.
"The main doors are blocked," Four says. "Formatting across the exit. I'm going through the service bay."
"There's no service bay exit—"
"There will be."
The VTOL's weapons fire. A wall explodes outward. Cold air screams into the cargo bay as they punch through into open sky.
Behind them, the Deliverance is dying. Elena sees it through the aft window — the massive carrier being eaten from the inside, the Geometry spreading through its corridors, its hull, its bones. Perfect black shapes where metal used to be.
"Fighters," Hendricks says. He's at the window, watching. "Three of them. Sovereignty interceptors."
"I see them."
"They're not chasing us. They're running."
"Smart."
Elena watches the interceptors scatter. One of them doesn't make it — the black shapes catch it mid-turn, and it becomes something else. Something perfect.
"Four. Can you outrun it?"
"Outrun? No." The VTOL shudders, engines screaming. "But I can outfly it."
She dives. Straight down, toward the cloud layer, toward the dark edge of the deletion zone below. Elena's hands go white on the handhold.
"What are you—"
"Standard taught me something." Four's voice is different now. Sharper. Alive. "She said I fly like a corpse. She was right. I was always trying not to die."
The clouds swallow them. Turbulence rattles the hull.
"But she flew like she was already dead. Like she had nothing to lose. Like the only thing that mattered was getting there."
They break through the cloud layer. Below them, the Geometry's edge — that perfect black line where the world stops making sense. Four is heading straight for it.
"FOUR—"
"I'm not going in. I'm going along."
The VTOL banks, following the deletion boundary. Skimming it. Close enough that Elena can see the shapes inside — the crystalline perfection, the absence of meaning. Close enough that one wrong move would end them.
Behind them, the Geometry doesn't follow. It's still focused on the Deliverance, on the feast of pattern and signal that's dying in the sky.
"They can't track us this close to the edge," Four says. "Too much interference. We're invisible."
"We're insane."
"Also that."
They fly along the boundary for what feels like hours. Minutes. Elena doesn't know. Time moves wrong this close to the deletion.
Then Four pulls up, and they're climbing, and the Geometry is behind them, and the sky ahead is clear.
"We're out," Four says. "Resuming course for Geneva. ETA: six hours."
"No." Hendricks is at the window, staring south. "The Quiet Zone. That's where he's taking her."
"We can't take the Quiet Zone with four people and a stolen VTOL."
"We're not leaving her."
"We're not." Elena's hand goes to her neck. "Geneva first. Then we go back for her."
Hendricks turns. That flat stare.
"Geneva?" he says. "There's nothing there. We were only going because I was dying."
"I have people there. Resources. A way to actually get her back instead of dying in the attempt."
"What people?"
"The kind who've been waiting for me to come home." She holds his stare. "Trust me."
He looks at her for a long moment. Eighteen years old. Ash's daughter. The girl who walked into NED and walked out with a black box.
"Geneva. Then we get her back."
"Then we get her back."
Four's voice, quieter: "Course confirmed. ETA: six hours."
Elena closes her eyes. The hum points west.
Standard will have to hold on.
