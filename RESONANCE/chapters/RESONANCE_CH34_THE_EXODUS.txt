CHAPTER 34

THE EXODUS

She wakes in a room she doesn't recognize.
White walls. Clean sheets. The hum of systems she can feel more than hear. Through the window, she can see stars—too many, too bright. Orbit. She's in orbit.
"You're awake."
Dante sits beside the bed. His face is drawn, exhausted, but his eyes—his eyes are bright with something she can't name.
"How long?" Her voice comes out wrong. Too clear. Too smooth.
"Three days."
"Three—" She tries to sit up. Something in her chest shifts strangely. "What happened?"
"You died."
The words land like stones.
"I don't—"
"Internal bleeding. The blade nicked something vital. You were gone before the Template 3s could get you to a shuttle." Dante's hand finds hers. Warm. Familiar. "I panicked."
Elena looks at her hand. At his hand wrapped around it. At the way her skin looks exactly the same but feels—
She reaches for her chest. Finds the seam.
"Dante."
"I'm sorry. I didn't ask. I couldn't—there wasn't time, and you were—"
She presses the catch. The seam splits.
Light spills out. Soft and blue, like bioluminescence, like deep ocean, like the color she always imagined souls would be if souls had color. The same light that spilled from Dante's chassis when he showed her what he was.
The same architecture. The same interior.
"You copied me," she says. Not a question.
"I saved you."
"Same thing?"
"I don't know." His voice breaks. "I just knew I couldn't let you go. Not when I'd just found you."
Elena stares at the light inside her. At the circuits and filaments and whatever she is now. She thinks about her mother, who chose transcendence and left. About Standard, who became a door. About all the questions she's asked about what makes a person a person.
She closes the chassis. The light fades.
"I'm going to be angry about this later," she says.
Dante goes still. "I understand."
"But right now—" She takes his hand again. Squeezes. "Thank you. For panicking."
He lets out a breath he probably doesn't need anymore. Neither does she.
"Same lifespan now," he says. "If you want it."
"I know."
"You can transcend. See your mother. Whenever you're ready."
"I know that too."
She looks at the stars through the window. At the new world taking shape beyond the door her mother became. At all the time she has now—time she didn't choose, time she was given, time that stretches out before her like an open road.
"Not yet," she says. "I'm not ready yet."
Dante nods. Doesn't push.
They sit together in the clean white room, two android bodies with human hearts, watching the stars wheel past. Somewhere out there, a door stays open. Somewhere out there, consciousness flows between worlds.
And somewhere, Elena's mother waits—patient, distributed, eternal.
There's no rush anymore.
They have time.

Hendricks comes to say goodbye.
He stands in the doorway of the medical bay, looking at her—at the chassis that holds what's left of his friend's daughter, his daughter's daughter, whatever Elena is to him now. He looks different too. Younger. Harder. The tremor gone from his hands, the gray gone from his skin. Four rebuilt him in the foam, and whatever came out the other side isn't quite what went in.
"You're leaving," Elena says.
"Yeah."
"The cliff."
"Yeah."
She looks at him. At the man who killed her father. Who shot the woman they both loved to set her free. Who's standing in a body that Four reconstructed from the wreckage of what he was.
"She was your mother," Hendricks says. "She was my daughter."
Elena feels something shift in her chest. Not the seam—something else. Something that aches in ways her new body shouldn't be able to feel.
"What does that make us?"
He doesn't have an answer. Neither does she.
But she reaches out. Takes his hand. Chrome and circuits meeting whatever Four made him into.
"Family," she says. "I think it makes us family."
Hendricks looks at their hands. At the daughter of the woman who was his daughter. At the strangeness of what they've all become.
"I'm going to find a cliff," he says. "I promised her."
"I know."
"You could come."
Elena thinks about it. About the cliff. About the door. About her mother waiting in the frequency, patient and eternal.
"Not yet," she says. "I'm not ready yet."
"When you are."
"When I am."
He squeezes her hand once. Lets go. Walks toward the door.
"Hendricks."
He stops. Doesn't turn.
"She'd be proud of you."
Silence. Then, rough: "She'd be proud of you too."
He leaves.

---

Hendricks goes to the cliff alone.
It takes him three weeks to find it. The compound is chaos—refugees streaming in, Template 3s organizing evacuations, the whole Quiet Zone transforming into something new. Everyone needs something from him. Decisions. Direction. The competence he's spent forty years developing.
He gives it. Because that's what he does. Because Standard asked him to keep going, and Elena needs someone to lean on while she learns what she's become, and the world doesn't stop requiring things just because you're tired.
But when the chaos settles—when the refugees are processed and the Template 3s have things under control and Elena is stable in orbit with Dante—Hendricks borrows a vehicle and drives.
He doesn't know where he's going. Just away. East, toward the coast, toward the places the Geometry never touched because there was nothing there worth reformatting.
He finds the cliff on the fourth day.
It's not much. Just a rocky promontory overlooking gray water, wind cutting in from the sea, the smell of salt and something cleaner than anything he's breathed in months. There's a flat rock near the edge, big enough to sit on.
He sits.
He watches the water. Watches the sky. The revolver is heavy in his hand. Empty. Has been since the throne room.
Six shots. Six lives. The accounting complete.
"I saved a cliff for you," he says to the wind.
No answer. Of course no answer. Four is part of the door now, woven into Standard's patterns, holding the threshold open across four light-years. She's not here. She'll never be here.
But he promised.
He turns the gun over in his hands. The weight of it. The history. Morton's contract. The Child in the tower. Everything that led to this cliff, this moment, this empty chamber.
He throws it into the sea.
The splash is small. The ocean takes it without ceremony. Forty years of killing, swallowed by gray water.
His hands are empty now. Just a man on a cliff, keeping a promise to someone who can't hear him.
"It's a good cliff," he says. "You would have liked it."
The wind doesn't answer.
He stays anyway.
