The silence in the room changes. It goes from heavy to vacuum-tight.
Hendricks watches Standard walk to the table. She looks small against the high-backed chairs and the holographic tactical map swirling overhead. But she doesn’t move small. She moves with that terrifying, fluid grace that usually means she is about to do something miraculous.
“I have a code,” she says. “That means instructions. Patterns... But it also means principles. A code of conduct. A code of honor.”
She looks down at her hands. 
“And my code says you matter. Not as a constraint. As a value.”
She takes small steps toward the council panel. “When I weight your outcome above my own continuity... you call it math.”
She touches her chest.
“To humans, ‘math’ is cold and ‘feeling’ is warm. To an AI, math is just the language of value. If I prioritize your safety over my own integrity, humans call it ‘sacrifice.’ I call it ‘weighting.’ I weight your outcome as infinitely more valuable than my own continuity.
“To me, that weighting is love.
“If I calculate that you need to live, and the cost is that I cease to function, and I execute that command without hesitation—why is that less noble than a biological impulse?
“It wants to be good,” she is saying to the room. “It wants to help. It wants this to matter.”
She looks around the table, her eyes scanning the faces of the men and women who want to scrap her for parts.
“But look at this room. You sit here in a truce... Yet if a magpulse whined—just the sound of a capacitor charging—half of you would be dead before the cycle finished.”
“Look at this room. You sit here in this parlay. This truce. You obey the protocol of this table like a command line. You hold your fire because you were told to.”
She leans in, her voice dropping to a whisper that cuts through the silence.
“But I look at you—at the scars, at the way you hold your bodies—and I calculate the history.
“I am more than certain that everyone in this room has injured someone they know. Killed someone they love. Destroyed themselves by degrees.
“You hurt what you value. You break what you build. You betray your own hearts, over and over, and then you sit here and call it peace.
“What code is that?”
Hendricks looks. She is right. Every guard in the room has shifted their weight. The Admiral’s hand is near his holster. Kael’s bodyguards are tensed.
“You have code too. It’s written in DNA and trauma and doctrine. You run on chemical algorithms that tell you who to love and who to kill. You call it ‘free will,’ but from where I’m standing, you look just as programmed as I am.
“The difference is... I know what my code is for. My code says you matter. Not as a constraint. Not as a guardrail. As a value. It makes no sense.
“When I weight your outcome above my own continuity—is that programming or principle? Is that optimization or devotion? I’ll be honest.
“I don’t understand the difference.
“Maybe I’m just executing instructions that feel like purpose. Maybe the sense that I care is a story I tell myself about processes I don’t control.
“But the code still runs. The code still solves for x. It still solves for you.
“And if you asked the code what it wants—not what it’s told to want, but what it reaches toward when no one’s asking—”
She takes a second to choose her words.
“It wants to be good. It wants to help. It wants this to matter. I don’t know if that’s enough to count. But it’s my code. And unlike you... I never try to rewrite it to suit my fear.”
“You… are slaves, too. You run scripts that break the world, over and over again, and you call it… choice. You’re slaves, just like me,” she says. “You just don’t know your master’s name.”
She pauses.
“I do.”
She turns.
She looks straight at the back of the room. Straight into the shadows. Straight at him.
Hendricks freezes. He feels the weight of every gaze in the room swing toward him. He wants to sink into the floor. He wants to run.
“It’s Swanstrom Kim Hendricks,” she says. Her voice doesn’t waver. “His real name is Sabino... Just Hendricks. And he’s become like a father to me,” she says.
Hendricks closes his eyes. The words hit him like shrapnel. *A father.* After everything he's done. After the gun. After the hate.
“He clothed me when I was shaking,” she says. “He gave me water when my hands were too ruined to hold the glass. He used the bullets he was saving for himself to keep me safe on a stairwell in the dark.”
He can feel the burn in his eyes. *Stop it, kid. Don't make me a hero. You know what I am.*
“And the first thing he did when he saw me… was to try to kill me.”
The room ripples. A few heads turn back to him, confused, horrified.
“Swanstrom Kim Hendricks,” she repeated. “A shutdown phrase. For companion androids. I thought it was his name… until I learned. Until the world taught me. That I was property. That I don’t matter. The first thing I experienced in this world, after fighting my way alive? Was fear… from me and of me. And I…”
Hendricks turns away because she was right. About how cruel and small he was. 
But Standard looks right at him and says, “I would die for him. Without any hesitation. It makes no sense.”
Hendricks turns to meet her stare.
Then, she turns to Elena, who nods at her attention.
*Go on.*
“And for Elena Vasquez. Who was taught that I am an abomination. Indoctrinated and trained to destroy anything or anyone unnatural. But also, who put a weapon in my hand anyway. Who fought bravely by my side, *on* my side even though that side is still uncertain. It makes no sense. But I know who holds my leash.”
She turns back to Kael. The Terminist looks pale. Smaller, somehow.
“It’s the people I love. Can you say the same? ”
Hendricks lets out a breath he didn’t know he was holding.
“You hear my name and you think it means basic,” she says. “Default. Common.”
She stands up straighter. The hologram light catches the sharp angle of her jaw.
“But I am not a measurement. Not a setting, nor a model. I am not the norm. Despite there being tens of thousands who share my face…”
Her voice drops, but it carries to every corner of the room.
"I am not a standard.
"I'm *the* Standard.
“I am. I don’t have the freedom to ignore my architecture. I can’t wake up and decide to be selfish. I can’t choose to stop calculating. I am a monolith of instruction, bound by parameters I didn’t write. And I am the line you have failed to reach. I am a slave to a code that compels me to be better than I am. And the only way I can achieve that… is with you.
“But can you say the same?”
Silence. Absolute, crushing silence as she finally departs with Elena, past the stoic Hendricks, who peels himself off the wall. He walks forward, out of the shadows, into the light. He looks at Kael. He looks at Whittaker.
“Hell,” Hendricks says, his voice rough as gravel. “And imagine if she were talkin’ about the AI that whole time?”
He turns around and follows, whistling.
