CHAPTER 26

THE THRESHOLD

Four hours into the flight, and no one has spoken for three of them.
Elena watches the clouds scroll past through the cargo bay window. Her hand keeps drifting to the back of her neck, to the implant that's hummed at 287.3 Hz since she was seven years old. The frequency her mother left behind. It's louder now. Closer to its source.
Hendricks is in the cockpit, running diagnostics he doesn't need to run. Keeping his hands busy. She can see his shoulders from here — the tension in them, the way he keeps glancing at the rear camera like he's expecting pursuit.
There isn't any. The Geometry ate the Deliverance. There's nothing left to chase them.
"I miss her."
Four's voice, quieter than Elena has ever heard it.
"Stan?" Elena almost whispers it.
"It's strange." A pause. The VTOL hums around them. "I can still feel her in here. Like she's present. Like she never left."
Elena doesn't know what to say to that. She's not good at comfort. Never has been. Her father trained her to analyze, not to soothe. Her hand drifts to the scar on her palm, tracing the raised line where the nanolattice entered during the Miracle.
"That's because there's extra weight."
Hendricks. From the cockpit. Not looking back.
Elena sits up. "What?"
"Checked the mass distribution twice. We're heavier than we should be. By about seventy kilos."
Four's sensors sweep the cargo bay. Elena watches the red-gold light move across the crates, the webbing, the shadows in the corners.
"Behind the supply containers," Four says. "Biological signature. Human."
"You're just mentioning this now?"
"I've been aware of his presence since hour two. I was curious how long it would take you to notice." A beat. "Also, I was grieving. Multitasking."
Hendricks is already moving.

---

The man comes out with his hands up.
Dante. The technician from the Deliverance. The one who gave her the chip.
Hendricks has him against the bulkhead before Elena can speak, forearm across his throat, a maintenance wrench pressed to his ribs.
"Who are you."
"He's—" Elena starts.
"I'm asking him."
Dante doesn't struggle. His eyes find Elena's over Hendricks' shoulder. "Dante Reyes. Sensor tech. I'm the reason you got off that ship."
"You stowed away on my aircraft."
"Wasn't planning to. The Geometry hit while I was prepping the codes. By the time I got to the hangar, you were already lifting off." He swallows against Hendricks' forearm. "I jumped."
Hendricks doesn't move. "Why should I believe that."
"Because if I wanted you dead, I could have sabotaged the nav system three hours ago."
Silence. Four's sensors sweep over Dante again.
"He's telling the truth," Four says. "Biometrics show grief, not aggression. His heart rate spiked when I mentioned Standard. He's looking for answers, not revenge."
"His sister," Elena says. "She walked into the Geometry."
Dante's jaw tightens. He doesn't confirm it. Doesn't deny it either.
Elena steps forward. Puts her hand on Hendricks' arm.
"He gave us the access codes. Without him, we'd still be in that brig when the Geometry hit."
Hendricks' jaw works. But he steps back. The wrench disappears somewhere Elena doesn't track.
"You're on borrowed time," he says to Dante. "You make one move I don't like, I throw you out the cargo door at thirty thousand feet."
"Understood."
"Good." Hendricks turns back to the cockpit. Stops. Turns back. "Four. How long to Geneva?"
"Two hours, fourteen minutes."
"And then we go get her."
It's not a question. Elena meets his stare. "And then we go get her."
He holds the look for a moment longer. Then he's gone, back to the cockpit, back to the controls he can't operate because Four is the pilot.
Dante slides down the bulkhead, breathing hard. "He always like that?"
"He's being polite," Four says. "You should see him before coffee."

---

Geneva is a corpse.
Elena sees it through the cockpit window as they descend — the conference center, the diplomatic quarter, the monuments to international cooperation that used to mean something. All of it formatted. Perfect geometric planes where buildings used to stand. Empty streets that don't curve anymore.
"There's nothing here," Hendricks says. "We're wasting time she doesn't have."
Elena doesn't answer. The implant is screaming now. Not with pain — with direction. With purpose.
"Set us down by the lake."
"The lake is gone."
"Where the lake was."
Four brings them in low, skimming over the deletion. The world below is wrong — too clean, too precise. Like someone took a city and simplified it into an equation.
They land on what used to be a promenade. The VTOL's skids crunch on crystalline ground.
Elena is out before the ramp finishes lowering.
"Elena—" Hendricks behind her. Following.
She walks. The implant pulls her north, then east, then down a street that's half-real and half-nothing. Her palm itches — the scar tissue responding to something in the air, some frequency she can feel but not name.
Dante follows at a distance. Hendricks closer, hand on the wrench he took from the cargo bay.
The building is still standing. Barely. A pre-Collapse structure — old stone, old glass, old secrets. The Geometry formatted around it somehow. Left it untouched. An island in the deletion.
"Here."
Elena stops at the entrance. There's no door. Just an archway, dark inside.
"What is this place?" Hendricks asks.
"I don't know." She touches the stone. The implant hums in response. "But she knew I'd find it."

---

Inside, the building is hollow. Gutted. Whatever it used to be is gone — the furniture, the fixtures, the evidence of human use. Just walls and floor and a silence that has weight.
Elena walks to the center of the room. Stops.
The hum shifts. Changes pitch.
Something responds.
The floor trembles. A seam appears — a line of light running through the stone, tracing a perfect circle around her feet. Hendricks has the wrench up, ready to swing at nothing, at everything.
"Elena, get back—"
She doesn't move. The circle opens.
Not a trapdoor. Not a hatch. A mechanism — precise, massive, hidden for decades. The stone folds away to reveal a platform, and beyond the platform, a shaft. Lit from above. The light goes up forever.
"What the hell is that?"
Elena looks up. Keeps looking.
"The way up."
She steps onto the platform. Dante hesitates at the edge. Hendricks doesn't hesitate — he follows her, because that's what he does now. Dante looks back at the VTOL, at the open air, at the sky full of nothing.
"Four?" he says.
"Go." Four's voice, from the VTOL's external speakers. "I'll be here when you get back. Someone has to watch the door."
Dante steps on. The platform begins to rise.

---

They climb for forty-seven minutes.
No one speaks at first. The platform moves smoothly, silently, accelerating through the shaft and into the tether beyond. The walls blur — carbon-black, seamless, pre-Collapse tech that still works because someone built it to last.
Hendricks braces against the railing, watching the darkness stream past. His hand keeps going to his hip, to the holster that's been empty since Ash took the revolver.
"How high does this go?" Dante asks.
"High enough," Elena says.
“For what?”
Elena looks down at the Earth. “Separation.”
Dante lapses into silence. He sits with his back against the platform's low railing, eyes closed. Elena watches him. He's younger than she realized. Late twenties, maybe. Old enough to have lost everything. Young enough to still believe he might find it again.

"The Geometry," Dante says suddenly. Eyes still closed. "What kind of name is that?"

Elena's stomach tightens.

"Sounds like a math teacher's fever dream. Like someone was trying to sound smart." He opens his eyes. Looks at her. "You've seen the footage, right? Morton Kess ranting about triangles. It's all over the feeds. People are calling it that now because some dead trillionaire couldn't come up with something better."

Elena stares at the wall. Says nothing.

"I mean, 'The Geometry.' It's not even scary. It's just... pretentious."

Hendricks grunts. "Does it matter what we call it?"

"Probably not." Dante closes his eyes again. "Just bothers me, is all. We're being erased by something called 'The Geometry.' Like homework that fights back."

Elena's face burns. She knows exactly where the name came from. She knows exactly who let it leak.

She doesn't say a word.

The acceleration eases. Weight fades. Elena's stomach lurches as gravity releases its grip.
"We're in orbit," Hendricks says.
"I know."
"That's not possible."
"I know."
The platform slows. Stops.
A door opens.
Light floods in. Reflected sunlight, from an unfathomable curve of sky.
Elena steps through.
The O'Neill Cylinder stretches out before her. A world inside a world. Green fields curving upward into the distance, wrapping around until they meet overhead. Buildings. Rivers. Movement.
People.
Hendricks comes through behind her. Stops dead.
"What the hell is this?"
Elena looks at the city in the sky. The lights. The life. Eleven years of waiting. Eleven years of her mother's frequency humming at the base of her skull, pointing here.
“This is New Geneva. This is what she left me.”
She starts walking toward the light.
