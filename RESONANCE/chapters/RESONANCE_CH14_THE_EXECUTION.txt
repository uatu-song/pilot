**Chapter 14: The Execution**
**POV:** Standard, Elena
**Tense:** Present

---

The armory is a closet that someone has tried very hard to make into something more. Racks of equipment line the walls—body armor, helmets, weapons Standard doesn't recognize—and Elena moves through it with the efficiency of someone who has done this before, who knows exactly which hook holds what, which drawer sticks, which vest will fit a body she's only seen horizontal and bleeding.
"Put this on." Elena shoves a tactical vest into Standard's hands without looking at her. The Kevlar is stiff under Standard's fingers, cold, and it smells like someone else—old sweat worked into the weave, the ghost of a body that used to wear it. She pulls it over the hospital gown and feels the weight settle across her shoulders, unfamiliar but not unwelcome. A shell. A second skin.
"Boots." Elena kicks a pair across the floor. "They'll be too big. Deal with it."
They are too big. Standard laces them tight anyway, pulling until the leather creases, until her feet feel strange inside them—armored, distant from the ground she's been walking barefoot for days. She stands. The extra weight changes her balance. She adjusts without thinking about it.
Elena has already armed herself—two magpulse rifles checked and slung, a sidearm at her hip—and now she presses a third rifle into Standard's hands. The grip is cold. The weight is wrong. Standard holds it the way she's seen Elena hold hers, but she can feel the difference in her bones: this is not a tool she knows.
"Can you shoot?"
Standard looks at the weapon. At the barrel, the trigger, the stock pressed against her forearm. She searches for the knowledge the way she searched for her name in that apartment, reaching for a shelf that should hold something.
"I don't know."
"Pull that part, press that to release safety, now you're good to go. Point the end with the hole at what you want to stop moving. Press the trigger." Elena's voice is clipped, fast, the words delivered like ammunition. "Don't point it at me or Hendricks."
She's already moving toward the door. Standard follows. She is good at following.

---

The alley is narrow and gray, a corridor of concrete with a strip of colorless sky above. Elena cracks the service door wider and Standard sees the compound spread beyond—acoustic dampeners rising like dead trees across a courtyard of wet stone, the Tower at the center, and between here and there, movement. Guards. Dozens of them. The faithful, gathering in concentric circles around a raised platform that sits at the heart of the space like an altar.
Elena's jaw tightens. Standard watches her count rifles, calculate distances, measure the odds the way Hendricks measures a room. The math isn't good. Standard can see it in the set of Elena's shoulders.
"Execution formation," Elena says. "He's doing it public. Hendricks is the centerpiece—they'll bring him out last."
Standard watches the gathering crowd. They are silent, all of them, their faces turned toward the empty platform with the patience of people who have learned to wait for violence. She wonders if they can hear anything at all, or if the dampeners have taken that from them too.
"I need you to find transport." Elena doesn't look at her. Her eyes are still on the courtyard, still calculating. "Motor pool, east side. Find something that moves. Come back for us."
"How will I know when?"
Elena is already moving, slipping into the shadow of the nearest dampener, her body folding into the gray like she was made for it. "You'll know," she says, and she doesn't look back, and Standard is alone.

---

Standard runs.
The boots are heavy but her legs know what to do, carrying her east through the maze of low buildings and silent machinery. The motor pool spreads before her—a field of asphalt and concrete under jaundiced floodlights, the shadows sharp-edged, the air thick with diesel and the cold mineral smell of hydraulic fluid. Ground-rovers sit in rows, armored and angular. Transport trucks. A fuel tanker with rust climbing its sides.
She moves through them, looking for something she can't name. Her hand trails along the hull of a rover, the metal cold under her fingertips, and she feels nothing—no pull, no recognition, just dead weight waiting for someone else's purpose.
At the far edge of the pad, tucked into a corner like an afterthought: a matte-black shape with four rotors folded against its hull. It is smaller than the rovers, sleeker, built for speed rather than cargo. Standard moves toward it before she understands why. Her feet carry her across the asphalt, her hand reaches for the hatch, and when she sees the palm-reader glowing faint blue beside the seal, she doesn't hesitate.
She presses her hand to it.
The lock opens.

---

Elena moves through the crowd.
The faithful part around her without knowing why—some instinct older than doctrine telling them to make room for the woman in stolen gray fatigues, the one walking toward the Dais with her hands at her sides and her eyes fixed on the platform ahead. They cannot hear her footsteps. They cannot hear anything. But they feel her passing like a cold draft, and they step aside.
On the Dais, Hendricks kneels.
His hands are bound behind him, his head bowed, his body so still he could already be dead. The executioner stands behind him—a broad man in ceremonial black, blade resting across his palms like an offering. And at the front of the platform, bathed in the gray dawn light, her father preaches.
Elena cannot hear the words, but she knows them. She grew up on them. The scripture of silence, the gospel of the unplugged, the promise that flesh untainted by signal would inherit whatever the machines left behind. Ash's hands move through the air, shaping meaning for the deaf congregation, his gold-threaded scars catching the light with every gesture. He is beautiful up there. He always was. A prophet in his element, selling salvation to people who have already paid for it in blood.
Fifty meters. Elena keeps walking.
Ash's hands sweep wide—the part of the sermon where he names the sin. She can see Hendricks flinch, see the crowd surge forward with silent rage. The man who killed the Child. The man who started everything. They want his blood. Her father is giving them permission to want it.
Forty meters. The executioner shifts his grip on the blade.
Ash raises one hand—the signal. The moment before the swing.
Elena thinks of Otis stepping into the beam. Of Aikin closing his eyes and calling it music. Of the hologram smiling as it died, offering her something she hadn't earned: *It's okay.* None of them deserved what they got. Otis didn't deserve to save her. Aikin didn't deserve peace. The machine didn't deserve forgiveness.
And Hendricks doesn't deserve this.
That's the point.
Elena draws.
The shot takes the executioner in the chest before anyone understands what the sound means. He staggers backward, the blade spinning from his grip, clattering across the platform. The crowd freezes for a single, perfect second—four hundred faces turning toward the source of the thunder, four hundred mouths opening in silent confusion.
Then Elena fires again.
Two guards rushing the platform from the left. They drop before they clear the stairs. The crowd erupts—bodies scattering in every direction, the silent panic of people who feel gunfire in their bones but cannot hear it coming. Elena moves through the chaos like current through water, her rifle up, her eyes tracking movement. A guard rises from behind the Dais; she puts him down. Another breaks from the fleeing crowd with his weapon raised; she shoots him twice, center mass, doesn't watch him fall.
Through it all, her father hasn't moved. He stands at the edge of the platform, his hands still raised, watching his daughter cut through his congregation like a blade through silk. His mouth is moving. Still preaching. Still selling. The faithful who haven't fled are watching him, reading his lips, and Elena can see the words taking shape: The enemy reveals herself. The serpent in our garden. My own blood, corrupted.
She reaches the stairs. Climbs. Hendricks is staring at her with eyes that don't quite focus, his lips forming a word she can't read.
"You know what I did." His voice is a ruin. Not a question.
"Yeah, we all have our days." She cuts his bonds with the knife from her belt, hauls him upright. He sways, catches himself on her shoulder—then she shoves the second rifle into his chest.
He catches it. His hands stop shaking.
Forty years of muscle memory don't care if the body is dying. Hendricks brings the rifle up, sights on Ash, and fires in one motion. The shot sparks off the edge of the platform where her father stood half a second ago—but Ash is already gone, vanished into the chaos of fleeing bodies like smoke through a grate.
"Missed," Hendricks mutters.
"He's good at that."
Guards closing from three sides now. Elena puts her back against Hendricks' and they start shooting—methodical, efficient, two people who have done this before in lives they'd rather forget. A guard drops on her left. Another on his right. Reload. Keep moving. The Dais is an island and the tide is rising.
"What's the plan?" Hendricks asks between shots.
"This is it."
"Tell me you brought cigarettes."
"Fresh out."
He growls. "This is a terrible plan."
They keep shooting.
A round catches Elena's vest—center mass, the impact spinning her sideways. She gasps, stays upright, keeps firing. Hendricks grabs her arm and pulls her off the Dais, behind the executioner's block. Stone chips fly as rounds slam into their cover.
"How many left?" she asks.
Hendricks checks his cell. "Twelve. You?"
"Eight."
"That's not enough."
"I know."
They break cover together, moving toward a cargo container at the edge of the courtyard. Hendricks' leg gives out halfway there—he stumbles, catches himself on Elena's shoulder, keeps moving. A guard flanks left; Elena drops him. Another rises from behind a barricade; Hendricks puts two rounds through his chest.
They reach the container. Press their backs against cold metal. The courtyard has gone quiet—no more fleeing civilians, just guards forming a perimeter. Twenty of them. Maybe more. All waiting.
"We're not getting out of this," Hendricks says. It isn't despair. Just arithmetic.
"Probably not."
A sound cuts through the silence—amplified, distorted, echoing off the acoustic dampeners. A megaphone. Her father's voice, loud enough for even the deaf to feel in their bones.
"ELENA."
She doesn't answer.
"YOU HAVE TEN SECONDS TO LAY DOWN YOUR WEAPONS. AFTER THAT, MY PATIENCE ENDS."
Hendricks looks at her. His face is gray, slicked with sweat, but his eyes are steady. "Your call."
Elena looks at the guards. At the rifles trained on their position. At the man she came to save and the death she's brought them both.
"FIVE SECONDS."
She could surrender. Her father might let her live. Might.
"THREE."
Hendricks' hand finds hers. Squeezes once. Not comfort. Acknowledgment.
"ONE."
The light changes.
A shadow falls over the courtyard—vast, impossible, blotting out the gray sky. Elena looks up.
Standard.
Descending, arms spread wide. Falling from somewhere above the clouds—from nowhere—from nothing Elena can explain. The congregation's survivors see it. Guards freeze. Someone drops their rifle. Someone falls to their knees.
Standard hits the ground between them, absorbs the impact like it's nothing, and grabs them both—Elena under one arm, Hendricks under the other.
"Hold on."
And they rise.
Not fast. Not mechanical. They lift from the courtyard like a breath returning to the sky, the cable invisible against the gray clouds, and to the guards and the faithful and the survivors still frozen in the dust, it looks like ascension. It looks like rapture. The woman who walked through the frequency, who the drones left untouched, who Ash himself called a sign—she has come down from the heavens and carried away the sinners in her arms.
A guard drops to his knees. Then another. Rifles clatter to the ground. Someone is weeping. Someone is praying—hands moving in the old signs, the scripture of silence, begging the sky for meaning.
Ash stands alone at the edge of the courtyard, his megaphone forgotten, watching his daughter disappear into the clouds in the arms of something he cannot name.
His mouth is still moving. But no one is reading his lips anymore.
