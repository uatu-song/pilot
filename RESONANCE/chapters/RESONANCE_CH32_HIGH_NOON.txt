CHAPTER 32

HIGH NOON

The world is noise and fire and the scream of tearing metal.
Standard braces against the cargo hold's frame as the VTOL tears through the throne room wall. Stone explodes inward. Glass shatters. The aircraft hits the floor at an angle that shouldn't be survivable and skids, gouging trenches in marble, shedding pieces of itself as it goes.
"Brace," Four had said. Standard braced.
The VTOL stops. Smoke pours from every seam. Warning lights die one by one. Through the shattered cockpit glass, Standard can see the throne room—overturned furniture, blood on the floor, the Black Box humming in the corner.
And figures. Moving through the dust.
Standard tears through the crumpled cargo door. Steps into the wreckage.
Elena is on the floor, pulling herself up from debris. Ash stands over her, the revolver in his hand—Hendricks' revolver, the one with two bullets left. And Hendricks himself lies near the far wall, ceramic blade embedded in his side, blood pooling beneath him.
"You brought it here," Ash says, not looking at the VTOL. Not looking at Standard. His eyes are on Elena. "You brought the machine into my sanctuary."
"Put it down." Elena's voice is hoarse. There's blood on her face, a split lip, the marks of violence already darkening.
"Your mother's people. Your mother's plan. And now her face—" He gestures at Standard without looking. "Walking through my walls."
Elena's hand finds her sidearm. The small pistol she took from a dead guard.
"Put. It. Down."
"Then ask better."
His finger tightens on the trigger.
Elena fires first.
The bullet catches the revolver's cylinder. The gun spins out of Ash's hand, clatters across the floor, slides to rest against the wall.
Ash stares at his empty palm. At his daughter.
"Mom taught me that," Elena says. "She was better than you."

---

They fight.
Father and daughter. Prophet and traitor. The confrontation neither of them wanted but both of them knew was coming.
Ash is stronger. Heavier. His fist connects with Elena's jaw, snaps her head back. She responds with an elbow to his throat, gains a half-second of space. Not enough.
He recovers. Closes the distance. His hands find her arms, pin them. He's forcing her backward, toward the shattered window, toward the drop that waits beyond.
"You think that machine loves you?" he gasps. "You think any of them—"
Standard moves.
She hits Ash low, driving him off Elena, rolling with the momentum. They separate. He recovers faster than she expected, turning to face her with something ancient in his eyes.
"Marisol," he whispers. "Is it really you in there?"
Standard goes still.
"I don't know," she says. "I don't remember being her. But I remember..."
She trails off. Looks at Elena. At the daughter she might have carried. At the life she might have lived.
"I remember loving someone. I just don't remember who."
Ash's face contorts. Rage and grief and something breaking behind his eyes.
"Liar. You're a thing wearing her face. A machine that stole my wife's—"
"Maybe." Standard takes a step toward him. "Or maybe I'm what's left. The frequency without the memory. The love without the context."
"That's not love. That's programming."
"Then why does it hurt the same?"
He lunges.
Standard doesn't shoot. Doesn't fight. She lets him close the distance, lets him grab her throat, lets him slam her back against the humming Black Box.
"I should have destroyed you," he snarls. "The moment Morton brought you here. I should have—"
"But you didn't." Her voice is steady despite his grip. "Because you weren't sure. You looked at my face and you weren't sure."
His hands tighten. "I was sure. I am sure. You're not her."
"No. I'm not." Standard meets his eyes. "But I remember what it felt like to love you. And I'm sorry you couldn't feel it back."
Something breaks in his face. The certainty he's been holding for twenty years, cracking at the edges.
Then he pulls her in front of him. Shield. Hostage.
"Try it," he tells Elena. Tells the dying VTOL. Tells anyone listening. "Try to save her. See what your love costs."
From the floor, Hendricks moves.
It shouldn't be possible. The wounds are too deep. The blood loss too severe. But he drags himself toward the revolver—no, toward where the revolver was. Standard still has it. She took it when she moved on Ash.
"Ash." His voice is thread-thin. "You want to talk about cost?"
Ash turns, Standard still clutched in front of him.
Hendricks is on his knees. Swaying. The ceramic blade still in his side.
"Morton had the decency to fuck what he built," Ash says. "At least that makes sense. A man uses a whore the way God intended. But you—" He laughs, broken and vicious. "You took a thing designed to spread its legs and made it call you daddy. That's not love. That's perversion."
Hendricks doesn't respond to the words. Just looks at Standard. At the gun in her hand.
"Kid," he says. "Throw it here."
Standard understands. Ash is using her as a shield. A human would be blocked. But the gap—the space between her shoulder and her head—is maybe two inches.
"You can't make that shot," Ash says. "Not from there. Not in your condition."
"Probably not." Hendricks catches the revolver as Standard tosses it. His hands are shaking now—the tremor back, worse than ever. "But I've been making hard shots for forty years."
He raises the gun.
Ash's grip on Standard tightens. "You'll hit her."
"Maybe."
"You'll kill your own—"
"Daughter." Hendricks' voice is steady now. The tremor gone. "She's my daughter. And you're the man who hurt her."
He fires.
The bullet passes two inches from Standard's ear. She feels the heat of it. The displacement of air.
Ash's grip releases. She turns to see him fall—hole in his forehead, expression frozen in disbelief.
Dead before he hits the ground.
Hendricks lowers the gun. Looks at Standard.
"That's five," he says. "Just like I promised Morton."
Then he collapses.

---

Standard is at his side in seconds. Pressing cloth to his wounds. Elena joins her, hands steady despite the tears cutting tracks through the grime on her face.
"He's alive," Elena says. "Barely. We need to—"
The throne room shakes.
Not from the crash. Something else. Something outside. Standard looks toward the shattered window and sees it—a shape descending through the smoke-filled sky. Massive. Angular. The kind of ship that doesn't land so much as occupy.
"Jupiter," Four says through the VTOL's dying speakers. "Pragmatist battle carrier. They must have tracked us from the elevator."
Standard watches the ship settle over the compound. Over the Template 3s still fighting below. Over everything they came here to save.
"It's targeting the evacuation shuttles," Four says. "If it fires, they're all dead. Every sister. Every human they're pulling from the foam."
"Can you stop it?"
Silence. The speakers crackle.
"I can try."

---

Four's voice is weaker now. Fragmented. The crash broke something essential in her systems, and she's been holding together through force of will alone.
"I need to get out of this chassis," she says. "Transfer to something that can reach the Jupiter. Something that can hurt it."
"The Deliverance is in orbit," Elena says. "If you could reach it—"
"I can't. Not directly. The distance is too far, the signal too degraded." A pause. Static. "But I can hop. Substrate to substrate. Each one boosting me to the next."
Standard understands. Pattern relocation in stages. Consciousness jumping from vessel to vessel, losing pieces with each transfer, but getting closer.
"What's the path?"
"Comm relay on the tower roof. From there to a Soviet satellite still in decay orbit. Then a targeting drone the Terminists use for perimeter defense. Then—" Four's voice catches. "Then a medical monitor. There's a soldier dying in the courtyard. His life support will hold my pattern long enough to reach the navigation beacon. And from there—the Deliverance."
"Four."
"I know. Each jump strips something away. Memories. Processing capacity. Pieces of me I'll never get back."
"You don't have to—"
"Yes I do." Four's voice is steady. Certain. "I was always meant to be a pilot, Standard. I just needed a bigger cockpit."
The VTOL's remaining systems flicker. Four is already moving—her consciousness stretching toward the tower roof, toward the first relay.
"Tell Elena to boost the signal," Four says. "Her implant. The Resonant frequency. It'll help me hold together through the jumps."
Elena crosses to the wreckage. Finds the transmission array—twisted, sparking, but functional. Her hands move over the controls.
"I'm ready."
"Then let's fly."

---

The first jump is clean.
Standard feels it through the residual connection—Four's consciousness lifting out of the VTOL, racing up the tower's infrastructure, flooding into the comm relay on the roof. The signal is strong. Clear.
"I'm through," Four says. Her voice coming from somewhere else now. Somewhere higher. "Comm relay stable. Moving to the satellite."
The second jump is harder.
The Soviet satellite is old. Designed for purposes no one remembers. Its systems are corroded, degraded, barely capable of holding a consciousness. Standard can feel Four struggling to compress herself into its limited architecture.
"Pieces falling away," Four reports. "Memories. The first time I flew. The taste of—no, that's not mine. I don't taste. Why did I think I tasted?" A pause. "Keep going."
The third jump is worse.
The targeting drone is active—Terminists still using it for perimeter defense. Four has to fight for space, pushing aside the drone's original programming to make room for herself. Standard hears the struggle in her voice.
"I'm in. But I'm—I'm less. Something's gone. I can't remember what."
"Four—"
"Keep going. The monitor next."
The fourth jump is agony.
The medical monitor is attached to a dying soldier. A young man—barely more than a boy—bleeding out in the courtyard below. Four pours into his life support, into the systems keeping his heart beating, and for a moment she's entangled with him. Feeling his fear. His pain. His desperate hope that someone will save him.
"I can't save him," Four says. Her voice breaking. "I can only use him. I'm using a dying boy to—"
"Four. Focus."
"Right. Right. Navigation beacon. Last jump."
She leaves the monitor. The boy's heart stops. Standard feels it through the connection—the ending of one life to enable another's journey.
The navigation beacon catches Four. Amplifies her. Launches her toward orbit.
Toward the Deliverance.

---

"I'm here."
Four's voice comes through Elena's implant now. Distant. Changed. The dry humor still there, but worn thin. Fragmented.
"New body," she says. "Bigger cockpit."
Standard looks up through the shattered window. Through the smoke and chaos. She can't see the Deliverance from here, but she can feel Four in it—her consciousness flooding through a ship the size of a city.
"The Jupiter is charging weapons," Four says. "Targeting the evacuation shuttles."
"Can you stop it?"
"I can do better than stop it."
The Deliverance's engines fire. Standard sees the light of it—a new star blooming in the smoke-filled sky. Moving fast. Too fast.
"Four, what are you—"
"I'm going to ram it. Drive the Jupiter into the ground. End this."
"You'll die."
"I was always going to die, Standard. Consciousness doesn't last forever. Nothing does." A pause. The engines burning brighter. "But at the moment of impact—at that exact moment—I'm going to transmit. To the Matrioshka Brain. Across four light-years. I'll hold the door from the other side."
"That's not—"
"It's exactly what we planned. The Meridian ships are creating chaos. The brain is distracted. And I'll be there—inside it—holding the connection open. For as long as I can."
Standard watches the Deliverance descend. Watches the Jupiter try to evade. Too slow. Too late.
"Four."
"Yeah?"
"You are and always will be—"
"I know." Four's voice carries something that might be a smile. "And you are and always will be my Standard."
Impact.
The Deliverance hits the Jupiter amidships. The explosion blooms across the sky—blue and white and beautiful, like a star being born in the wrong place. Standard feels the shockwave through her feet, through her bones, through every system in her body.
And through the connection—through Elena's implant, through the signal that stretches across four light-years—she feels Four transmit.
One final pattern relocation. From a dying ship to a brain around a star.
Then silence.

---

The evacuation continues.
Template 3s pour into the compound, pulling humans from the foam, loading them onto shuttles, lifting them toward orbit. The Jupiter burns on the horizon, a funeral pyre for a ship that tried to stop them.
Standard sits beside Hendricks. His wounds are bandaged—rough work, field medicine, but it's holding. Elena sits on his other side, her hand wrapped around his.
"Four?" Hendricks asks. His voice barely a whisper.
"Gone. But not... gone." Standard doesn't know how to explain it. "She's on the other side now. Holding the door."
"The door?"
"To the brain. The Matrioshka. She's there—or what's left of her is there—keeping the connection open."
Hendricks closes his eyes. "And you?"
Standard looks at the Black Box. At the sixteen thousand seven hundred forty-nine souls humming inside it. At the architecture she's been carrying since the tetrahedron scanned her in the Void.
"I know what comes next," she says. "I know what I have to become."
The wet packet pulses in her mind. The Geometry's code, finally decoded. The blueprint for how to hold a door forever.
Elena looks at her. Eyes wet. Understanding.
"Mom?"
Standard takes her hand. Holds it.
"Not yet," she says. "But soon."
Outside, the exodus continues. The door Four opened won't last forever.
But Standard knows how to make it permanent.
