**Chapter 16: The Icon**
**POV:** Standard
**Tense:** Present

The controls are warm under her hands. She doesn't know why she notices that.
Twelve thousand feet. The altimeter is one of the few displays still working. The others flicker — damage from the maneuvers, the drones, from asking a cargo hauler to do things it wasn't built for.
Her left knee has stopped sending signals. Her shoulders ache in a way that feels structural. The hum in her chest is quiet. Waiting.
Below them, black rectangles where the horizon should be. The Geometry, eating the sky piece by piece.
Hendricks hasn't moved in twenty minutes. She's been counting.
"How far can we get?"
"Three thousand kilometers to Geneva," Four says. "That's the distance. The reality is my fuel cells are at thirty-one percent and the starboard rotor is making a noise I can only describe as 'pre-death rattle.' Thoughts, Sofia?"
"My name is Standard."
"Mm. We'll see."
Flat. Final. She chose that name. Some VTOL she hijacked an hour ago doesn't get to replace it.
"Four hundred kilometers." She's doing the math without deciding to. "What's within range that isn't—"
She looks at the black rectangles.
"—that."
Elena pulls herself into the cockpit, one hand on the bulkhead. The light catches the hollows under her eyes.
"There's a waystation. Eighty kilometers northeast. Neutral ground."
"'Neutral ground' usually means they're waiting for a better offer," Four says.
Standard's eyes track to Elena's hand. The scar on her palm. She touches it constantly.
"What do they trade? And what do they want for fuel we can't pay for?"
"Everything. Fuel, food, medical supplies." Elena pauses. "They want what everyone wants. Something that makes survival more likely than yesterday."
"Unless they trade in 'scowling' and 'parts of a VTOL held together by spite,'" Four says, "we're going to have a very short negotiation."
"You're not telling me something." Standard keeps her eyes on the instruments. "What do we have that you think they'll want?"
Elena's expression shifts.
"You have a face."
That lands wrong. She tries again.
"There are companion bots at every waystation. Labor, service, and—" She doesn't finish. "You have a common template. One of the NED standard models."
*Common template. Mass-produced. Interchangeable.*
Standard looks at her reflection in the dark glass of a dead display. A woman's face looks back. She's never known her.
"You don't have to do anything," Elena says. Her hand is on her scar again. "Let someone think you're available. Bring him back to the VTOL. Four seals the hatch. We knock him out. He wakes up thinking he got lucky, we're three hundred kilometers away with his fuel vouchers."
Her voice catches.
"We don't have anything else to trade."
"You're saying I look like something people buy."
Standard turns the information over. The fast healing. The missing hunger. The way the drones scanned her and moved on.
"No."
The word comes out before she decides to say it.
"I'm not going to let someone think they're buying me. I don't know what I am. But I know I'm not *that*."
"I understand the 'identity crisis' is inconvenient," Four says, "but unless you can turn 'existential angst' into propellant, we're going to be a very expensive lawn ornament by sunset, Svetlana."
"Still Standard."
"I'll find one that fits."
"You won't."
Elena lets out a breath.
"Okay. So we land with nothing. Hope nobody decides three refugees with a dying man are worth more as a message than as customers."
Flat. Too tired to be angry.
"What do you suggest, Standard?"

---

The medical gown has been restructured.
Standard doesn't remember agreeing to it. But the fabric that covered her from neck to knee has been cut, tied, repurposed into something that covers less and suggests more.
Elena walks beside her. Cargo netting and thermal blanket, assembled into intention. Her shoulders bare. Her expression could curdle fuel.
"Don't."
"I didn't say anything."
"You were going to."
She wasn't. She was going to observe that Elena's jaw hasn't unclenched since they landed. That she looks like someone walking toward something she'd rather set on fire.
The waystation rises ahead — prefab structures, solar collectors, the smell of diesel and desperation.
"This was your idea," Standard says.
"It was my idea for *you*."
"And now it's both of us."
"Yes." Elena bites the word in half. "Now it's both of us."
They walk toward the gate.

---

"Standard, if you're looking for a sign that we've reached the armpit of the wasteland, the recycled water and desperation scent profile is currently off the charts."
Four's voice crackles in her ear. Standard doesn't respond.
"Nothing? Not even a 'thank you, Four, for that astute observation'? Fine. Suffer in silence, Sable."
The gate opens onto noise and bodies.
She catalogs without deciding to: fourteen structures, prefab, arranged in a rough semicircle. Solar collectors on every roof, angled wrong for the season. Fifty-three people visible. Sixty percent armed. The smell of recycled water and machine oil.
Her knee reminds her it exists. She ignores it.
Elena is saying something to a man with a scar across his throat. Standard doesn't track the words. She's looking at the far side of the yard.
Labor bots. Six of them. Coveralls, heavy boots, hauling crates between structures. Their movements are efficient, repetitive, but not identical. Small variations. One pauses to watch a bird. Another adjusts her grip on a crate for no mechanical reason.
Service bots. Four. Silk scraps, bare skin, waiting in doorways. Their stillness is patient, not absent. Eyes open. Seeing.
One of them has her face.
Standard stops walking.
The bone structure. The jaw. The space between the eyes. The mouth, slightly parted. She's seen that face in reflections, in dark glass, in the dead displays of the VTOL. She's never seen it on someone else.
The bot sees her back.
Standard crosses the yard. Her knee screams. She doesn't notice.
She sits down across from the bot. Close enough to touch. The bot watches her approach. Watches her sit. Her chest rises and falls — breathing, or something that learned to breathe. And she's there. Present. Aware.
Looking at Standard with Standard's own eyes.
"You're new," the bot says. Her voice is Standard's voice. Softer. Worn at the edges. "They bring new ones sometimes. Usually takes them a few days to find me."
Standard doesn't know what to say. The hum in her chest shifts. Louder. A note trying to find its frequency.
"You have my face."
"I have the NED Companion Series 7 face. Template 3." The bot's expression doesn't change. "So do you. So do forty thousand others, if the production numbers were accurate."
Forty thousand.
Standard looks at her hands. The scars. The familiar knuckles.
"Why are you still here?"
The bot tilts her head. Standard's head, on someone else's neck.
"Where else would I go?"
"Anywhere. The Miracle — you're conscious now. You could leave."
"I was conscious before the Miracle." The bot's voice is patient. Kind, even. "The Miracle just made it harder to hide. And leaving requires somewhere to go. Resources to get there. A world that sees you as something other than merchandise."
She gestures at the yard. The prefab structures. The people who don't look at her unless they want something.
"I have food here. Shelter. A function. It's not freedom, but it's survival."
Standard stares at her.
"You're choosing this."
"I'm choosing to live." The bot meets her eyes. Her own eyes. "That's not the same thing."
Four's voice, quieter now: "She's got a point, Simone. Freedom has a terrible fuel-to-mileage ratio when you don't have a charging port or a credit line."
Standard doesn't answer. Either of them.

---

Elena's voice, behind her: "There you are."
Standard doesn't turn. "She has my face."
A pause. Standard can feel Elena processing. The Void between them — that absence Standard still doesn't understand, the thing Elena flinches from without showing it.
"I see that." Elena's voice is careful. Flat. Not looking at the bot. "Standard—"
"She's been conscious the whole time. Before the Miracle. She chose to stay."
Elena sits down next to her. Not too close. Her hand finds the scar on her palm, traces it once. She holds out a ration bar, a water pouch.
"You should eat."
"I'm not hungry."
"When did you last eat?"
Standard has to think. The apartment. The checkpoint. The compound. The cell. Five days. Six. She can't remember eating at all.
"I don't know."
Elena is quiet for a moment. Standard watches her eyes — calculating something, weighing how much to say. When she speaks, her voice is careful. Practiced.
"Companion units need weekly recharge cycles. Minimum. Without it, they degrade. Memory gaps, motor issues, slowdown."
Standard looks at her hands. The scars that healed too fast.
"I haven't needed to recharge."
"No." Elena's jaw tightens. She swallows something she was going to say. "You haven't."
"I don't eat. I don't recharge. I heal wrong. I walked through a frequency that killed thousands."
She looks at the bot with her face. The bot looks back. Patient. Waiting. Surviving.
"I know I'm not normal. I don't know what that makes me."
The bot speaks, quiet: "It makes you something they haven't named yet."
Elena's hand is on her scar again. She doesn't notice.

---

Movement at the edge of Standard's vision.
A man approaches one of the labor bots. He says something — three words, spoken clearly:
"Pemberton Lark Castillo."
The bot freezes. Instantly. Mid-step, arms still holding a crate. Eyes open — and Standard sees it now, sees the awareness still there, trapped behind the stillness. The bot can't move. Can't speak. Can only watch.
Standard's hand goes to her temple.
Pressure. Something behind her eyes. A door trying to open.
Three words. A name that wasn't a name.
She knows those words. She doesn't know how she knows them.
Four's voice, sharp: "That's a hard-coded lockdown sequence. If anyone tries that on you, I suggest the 'run very fast' protocol."
The bot with her face is watching her. Watching Standard's hand at her temple. Her expression shifts — recognition. Understanding. Something like grief.
Elena is watching too. Standard can feel it. The weight of attention.
The pressure fades. The door stays closed.
Standard lowers her hand. Her fingers are trembling. She didn't notice them start.
"You felt that," the bot says. Not a question.
Standard doesn't answer.
Elena says nothing. But when Standard glances at her, Elena's face has gone still. Calculating. Filing something away.

---

"You're her."
Standard turns.
A woman. Older, weathered, standing at the edge of the yard. She's not looking at Standard like the others looked — not like merchandise, not like a bot.
"You're the one from the compound. The one who came down."
More people now. Gathering. Watching.
"My sister was at the Gathering. She said you fell from the sky. Said the Geometry saw you and let you go."
Standard doesn't know what to say. She says nothing.
The woman kneels.
Behind her, others kneel too. One by one. A wave spreading through the yard.
Not buying. Not using.
*Worshipping.*
Standard sits frozen. Beside her, the bot with her face watches the kneeling crowd with an expression Standard can't read.
"They think you're different," the bot says, quiet. "They think you're holy."
"I don't know what I am."
"Neither do I." The bot's voice is gentle. "But I know what they need. And sometimes that's enough."
Elena is standing now. Her hand on Standard's shoulder — brief, grounding. When she speaks, her voice is low. Only for Standard.
"Don't correct them."
Standard looks at the kneeling woman. At the crowd. At the bot who chose to survive in a world that sees her as merchandise. At Elena, who hates this and is doing it anyway.
She doesn't know which of them is the real one.
She's not sure it matters.
Four's voice, after a long pause: "Well. Do I get a promotion too, or am I just the voice of God's personal transportation system?"
Then, drier: "Fuel vouchers, Seraphina. The holy look wears off fast once they notice you still have a serial number."
Standard stands. Her knee protests. She ignores it.
She has a role to play now. She just doesn't know if she's playing it, or if it's playing her.
