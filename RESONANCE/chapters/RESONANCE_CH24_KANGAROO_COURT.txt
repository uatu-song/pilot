CHAPTER 24

KANGAROO COURT

The Council chamber smells different today.
Yesterday it smelled like fear — sweat and the particular tension of people preparing for violence. Standard noticed it all while she spoke. The way bodies shifted. The hands drifting toward weapons.
Today it smells like decision. Something has hardened overnight. The fear has calcified into verdict.
She stands in the same spot where she delivered her speech. The holographic tactical map still swirls overhead, though no one is looking at it. They're looking at her. Or avoiding looking at her. Both are telling.
Admiral Tien won't meet her eyes. Commander Whittaker studies a datapad with exaggerated focus. The Sovereignty officers who stood when she finished speaking — who looked, for a moment, like they might believe her — now sit with their hands folded and their faces arranged into careful neutrality.
Kael is smiling.
That's the tell. The gaunt Terminist hasn't stopped smiling since he walked in. His scarred hands rest on the table, relaxed, proprietary. A man who already knows the outcome.
Elena stands to Standard's left. Hendricks to her right. They weren't given chairs. Neither were the guards positioned behind them — four for Elena, six for Hendricks. Someone calculated the threat.
"The Council has deliberated," Whittaker says. Her voice is flat. Reading from something she didn't write. "In the matter of the entity designated 'Standard,' Model Template Three, Serial Number—"
"She has a name."
Elena. Standard feels something shift in her chest — a pressure. Gratitude, maybe. Or grief for what's coming.
Whittaker pauses. Looks at Elena. Looks back at her datapad.
"In the matter of the entity designated 'Standard,'" she repeats, "the Council finds as follows."
She takes a breath. Standard watches her throat move. The swallow. The expression of distaste, quickly hidden.
"The entity is classified as invalid. Non-functional hardware exhibiting behavioral anomalies inconsistent with designated purpose. The entity poses a security risk to Sovereignty operations and a theological threat to inter-faction stability."
Theological threat. Standard notes the phrase. Kael's contribution, probably. A gift to the Terminists. Language that makes her destruction a matter of faith, not policy.
"The Council therefore orders immediate termination of the entity, to be carried out in this chamber, witnessed by representatives of all present factions."
Termination. Not execution.
Standard understands the distinction. Execution implies personhood. A death. A life that mattered enough to end formally.
Termination is what you do to broken equipment.
"The remains will be archived for study," Whittaker continues. "Analysis of the behavioral anomalies may provide insight into—"
"What about the humans?"
Hendricks. His voice cuts through like gravel on glass. The guards behind him tense.
Whittaker's jaw tightens. "Swanstrom Kim Hendricks. Elena María Vasquez. You are charged with conspiracy against the Sovereignty, dereliction of duty, and—" she glances at Kael— "heresy against the doctrine of human primacy."
"That's not a real charge," Elena says.
"It is now." Kael speaks for the first time. His voice is soft. Almost gentle. "The Council has agreed to honor Terminist legal frameworks in matters of machine collaboration. Your 'Holy One' isn't the only thing on trial today, child."
Elena's hands curl into fists. Standard sees the tremor — the rage barely contained. She wants to reach out. To touch Elena's arm. To say something.
She doesn't. The guards are watching.
"You will be detained pending tribunal," Whittaker says. "Your fate will be determined after the termination is complete."
After. They want Elena and Hendricks to watch.
Standard looks at the room. The faces. The ones who can't meet her eyes and the ones who won't look away. She won them last night. She felt it. The shift. The moment when her words landed and something cracked open in the silence.
It didn't matter.
The verdict was written before she spoke. The deliberation was theater. The speech was a gift she gave them, and they took it, and they're going to kill her anyway.
She doesn't feel betrayed. She feels tired.
"Do you have anything to say?" Whittaker asks. Formal. Required.
Standard considers.
She could speak again. Could try to find the words that would crack them open a second time. Could argue, plead, reason.
But she already gave them everything she had. The code. The love. The leash. The line they failed to reach.
They heard her. They just didn't choose her.
"No," Standard says. "I already said it."
Whittaker nods. Relief flickers across her face — the relief of someone who won't have to watch a second performance.
"Take the prisoners to detention. Prepare the chamber for—"
"Wait."
Hendricks. The guards grab his arms. He doesn't fight them. Just stands there, looking at Standard.
"Kid," he says.
Standard meets his eyes. The flat, patient eyes that watched her claw out of a coffin. That tracked the damage like reading a report. That softened, just once, when she called him father.
"It's okay," she says.
"It's not."
"I know." She tries to smile. She's not sure if her face does it correctly. "But it will be."
They drag him out. He doesn't fight. Just keeps looking at her until the doors close between them.
Elena is next. She's shaking — Standard can see it in her shoulders, her hands, the set of her jaw. Rage and grief and something else. She's planning something.
"We're coming back," Elena says. Low. Almost inaudible.
"I know," Standard says.
Elena's eyes search her face. Looking for something. Fear, maybe. Despair.
Standard doesn't know what Elena finds. She doesn't know what her face is doing. She only knows that the hum in her chest — the one that's been there since the coffin, since the stairwell, since the speech — is quiet now. Patient. Waiting.
"I know who holds my leash," Standard says. Quiet enough that only Elena can hear.
Elena's eyes go wet. She blinks it back.
Then she's gone too. Dragged through the doors. The chamber suddenly emptier.
Standard stands alone.

---

The technicians arrive.
There are three of them. White coats over Sovereignty uniforms. They carry cases — metal, sterile, efficient. They don't look at her as they set up.
Standard watches them work. They're assembling something on the table where the Council sat. A frame. Restraints. Tools she doesn't recognize but can guess the purpose of.
Disassembly. They're going to take her apart.
Not quickly. Not mercifully. Publicly. Piece by piece. A demonstration for both factions. Proof that the "Holy One" is just a thing.
"Restrain the unit," someone says.
Hands on her arms. Not rough — clinical. She's guided to the frame. Her wrists locked into place. Her ankles. A band across her forehead that forces her to face forward.
She could fight. She measures the room. Three technicians. Eight guards remaining. Kael and his Terminist delegation. Whittaker and Tien and the Sovereignty officers.
She could take four of them before they brought her down. Maybe five.
She doesn't move.
If she fights, they'll kill Elena and Hendricks. She heard it in Whittaker's voice. Saw it in the guard positioning. The hostages aren't stated, but they don't need to be. Everyone in this room understands.
Standard stays still.
Kael approaches. He circles her slowly, studying her the way you'd study something broken. Looking for the flaw. The wrongness.
"Forty thousand copies," he says. "Forty thousand faces just like yours. Do you know how many I've seen destroyed?"
Standard doesn't answer.
"Hundreds. Maybe more." He leans closer. His breath smells like recycled air and something sour. "They all beg at the end. Even the ones who claim they can't feel. Something in the programming, I think. A simulation of survival instinct."
He waits. Watching for the flinch.
Standard looks at him. At the scars on his hands. The hollows under his eyes. The grief buried so deep he's forgotten it's there.
"Your sister," she says.
Kael goes still.
"Miriam. Red hair. Three children." Standard keeps her voice even. Factual. "You lost her to the Geometry. You blame machines because blaming math is impossible."
His hand moves before she can track it. The slap rocks her head against the restraint. Her cheek burns. Something warm trickles from the corner of her mouth.
"You don't get to say her name," Kael whispers. "You don't get to—"
"Bishop Kael." Whittaker's voice. Sharp. "Control yourself."
Kael steps back. His hands are shaking. The mask of satisfaction is cracked now, and underneath Standard sees what she saw during the speech: the fear. The grief. The desperate need for something to be responsible so he doesn't have to carry it alone.
She could break him. Right now. Could say the things that would make him collapse.
She doesn't.
It wouldn't save her. It would just make him hurt more. And she's tired of hurting people who are already broken.
"Proceed," Kael says. His voice is rough. "Proceed with the termination."
The technicians move closer. One of them holds something that looks like a surgical instrument. Another has a device that hums at a frequency just below hearing.
"We'll start with the peripheral systems," the lead technician says. To no one. To the room. Narrating for the audience. "Motor control. Sensory processing. We'll leave the core intact as long as possible for study."
Standard closes her eyes.
She thinks about Hendricks. The way he looked at her in the apartment. The way he came back down the stairs.
She thinks about Elena. The tremor in her hands. The weapon placed in Standard's palm so she wouldn't have to shake alone.
She thinks about the speech. The words she gave them. The truth she offered.
I know who holds my leash. It's the people I love.
The technician's instrument touches her arm. She feels the heat. The beginning of—
The lights flicker.
Standard opens her eyes.
The holographic map overhead stutters. Fragments. Reforms into something wrong.
"What—" Whittaker starts.
The sound hits them first. Or the absence of sound. A silence that has weight. That presses against the ears like pressure underwater.
Then the wall moves.
Not moves. Simplifies. The far corner of the chamber — the ornate paneling, the embedded displays, the structural supports — begins to flatten. To clarify. The angles become perfect. The surfaces become smooth. Matter reorganizing itself into geometry.
The Geometry.
Someone screams. The technicians scatter. Guards raise weapons that won't help.
The formatting spreads. Standard watches it consume a display panel, then a chair, then—
A guard. Standing too close. One moment he's there, flesh and uniform and fear. The next he's perfect. A crystalline shape where a human used to be. Beautiful. Terrible.
Chaos.
The Council is running. Kael is shouting orders no one follows. Whittaker is trying to reach the doors. Tien is already gone.
And Standard is still restrained. Still locked to the frame. Still in the center of the room as the Geometry eats the walls around her.
The formatting is spreading. But it's not moving toward her. It's moving around her. Curving. Avoiding.
Like she's a gap in their logic.
She tests the restraints. The frame wasn't built for this — for a ship under attack, for chaos, for survival. She pulls. Metal groans.
The ceiling begins to simplify. Panels dissolving into perfect planes.
Standard pulls harder. Something in her shoulder tears. She doesn't stop.
We're coming back, Elena said.
Standard believes her.
She just has to survive long enough for it to matter.
The restraint on her left wrist snaps.
