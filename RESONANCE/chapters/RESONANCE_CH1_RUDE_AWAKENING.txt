A drilling high-pitch in her ears and she awakens, if this counts as awake, wondering if she died. It would explain the pitch black and claustrophobic confinement. 
She is lying horizontally, as far as she can tell, and only has enough room to slide her forearms along her chest to bring them to her face.
To scream.
To push futilely against six feet of earth. Or was it twelve? It may as well be a hundred for all the good her arms are able to muster.
Stop crying.
But she can’t stop crying, grunting while she tries to ignore the sensations of her fingertips bleeding from the cuticles—some torn, some exposing nail beds—until even in her panic she stops clawing and, eventually, stops crying.
She closes her eyes for some reason, even though she can’t see the casket door inches from her nose, as she forces her heaving breaths to grind into a less expensive respiration; it is only logical there would only be so much she could take in before she couldn’t, before she’d really earn her current place.
Stop crying!
The realization dawns on her that she has limited time but tries to push it aside as she focuses on slowing everything down.
In. Hold. Out. Hold. In. Fill chest and diaphragm. Hold. Out. Slow—4—5.
Her eyes open.
Okay.
It was a hefty price tag in whatever remaining air there is in her encasement but in order to thrive, one first needs to survive; to think, to solve the problem at hand.
Instead of pounding, pushing, and scratching, she feels, with her fingers—ruined now, the pads raw and weeping where skin has peeled back—but no less sensitive to the surface she begins to investigate, to search, to—
What—what is that?
Some… groove? Seam? She traces it with what remains of her fingertips, dead center, bisecting her from her head to as low as she can reach without bumping her forehead against the confinement.
Okay.
Her hands come together, elbows tight against her sides, and she closes her eyes again. She takes a deep breath in and slows her mind as much as she can.
“Please, God,” she utters.
The prayer hands jab forward, trying like hell to wedge themselves into the groove in the center. Pain shoots straight up through her arms—she feels her palms split against the sharp edge—and clearly registers but another part of her is telling it to shut the fuck up.
Her voice goes hoarse as it tears through her throat—a sound she doesn’t recognize as her own—expending any air remaining in her lungs when, at that moment, her hands breach. She could cry with relief but another part of her is telling her to shut the fuck up. You’re not alive yet. Keep going. Finish what you started.
First, air, blessed air, peeps in. She can feel it but refuses to be satiated by such a pittance when she wants to reclaim what is her right to breathe.
And then, there is light. She wasn’t in hell after all.
Another scream and she falls upward, with such force, the cover which lost the battle of containing her flies off its hinges—the edge caught her temple as she wrenched through, caught her forearms on the lip as she tumbled, her body twisting wrong as it meets the floor. She didn’t know she was naked until right then, breathing in ragged gasps and through streams of tears, of relief or injustice, she can’t tell. Something warm runs down the side of her face. Her arms were striped with scrapes, ugly and raw, and her hands—she can’t look at her hands.
The man at the kitchen table doesn’t flinch.
He’s pressing a bloody towel to the back of his neck with one hand. The other lies flat on the table like it is the only thing holding him upright. His face, pale, sheened with sweat, and his whole body is shaking—a fine tremor that runs from his shoulders down through his fingertips.
On the table: a utility blade. A bottle of gin. A hand mirror.
Blood on all of it.
She stumbles back, grasping at herself to cover her nakedness from this stranger’s eyes—but his eyes. They weren’t on her body. They are on her hands. The gash at her temple. The blood matting her hair.
He’s tracking the damage like he was reading a report. Then, almost imperceptibly, his gaze flicks to the destroyed crate behind her. The lid she tore off its hinges. The dark interior she clawed her way out of.
Something in his expression shifts.
Not surprise.
The quiet settling of a man who has just lost a bet with himself.
