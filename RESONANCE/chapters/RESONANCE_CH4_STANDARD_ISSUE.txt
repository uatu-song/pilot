They descend.
The stairwell is a throat of cold concrete and sodium lights that buzz like trapped insects. Graffiti layers the walls—scratches over spray paint over old warning signs that have dissolved into abstract shapes.
Hendricks leads. He is not walking well. He leans on the railing, his weight heavy on his right side, his hand leaving a smear of sweat on the metal. The towel at his neck is dark with fresh blood.
The woman is two steps behind. She watches him.
His left leg shakes when it hits the step. His breathing sounds wet. He grips the railing like he’s afraid of falling, and he should be—twice now she’s seen his knee buckle before he catches himself.
He is getting worse. She knows this the way she knows the distance to the next landing, or the temperature dropping as they go deeper. Something is wrong with him, and it’s getting wronger.
She asks the first question.
“Where are we going?”
He doesn’t answer. Keeps moving, one boot in front of the other.
They pass Level 50. The air grows thicker, tasting of wet iron.
She asks the second question.
“Who is chasing us?”
Nothing. Just the scrape of his boots and the rasp of his breathing. He is withholding information. She doesn’t understand why. Communication coordinates survival. This is basic.
They pass Level 48.
She asks the third question.
“Why did you come back for me?”
He stops.
His hand tightens on the railing until the knuckles go white. He stands there for a long moment, staring down into the dark of the shaft.
He doesn’t turn. He doesn’t speak.
Then he starts walking again.
Level 42.
They emerge from the shadows of a service corridor. Three of them.
They are not police. They are scavengers—armor made of license plates and server casing strapped over dirty fatigues. Their skin is mapped with scars of removed tech: pockmarks at the temples, gouges on the wrists. Former Preventers, maybe, or just bottom-feeders fishing the stairwell for anyone trying to flee the noise.
“Hold up, meat,” the leader grunts. Big. His face a ruin of burn tissue. He holds a scanner that looks like it was salvaged from a garbage compactor.
Hendricks stops. He doesn’t reach for the weapon at his hip. He just leans against the wall, trying to breathe.
“Toll,” the leader says. “Toll for the Quiet. Show pocket.”
Hendricks doesn’t move. One of the others—a wire-thin woman with filed teeth—steps forward and pats him down. She finds the revolver.
She pulls it out. Holds it up to the sodium light.
“Heavy iron,” she says. Turns it over. Frowns. “No charge-hole. No cell.”
“Junk,” the leader says. “Museum trash.”
The woman laughs—a sharp, barking sound—and tosses the weapon. It hits the stairs, skids, comes to rest against the wall two flights down. Metal on concrete, ringing out.
Hendricks watches it go. He doesn’t react.
“Scan ‘im,” the leader orders.
The scanner washes over Hendricks. A beam of dirty red light. It beeps—a low, flat tone.
“Meat,” the leader says, looking at the readout. “Pure meat. Fresh clip on the neck, though. Bleeder.” He looks at Hendricks with something like pity, or maybe just boredom. “Go on, old soft. Fall down somewhere else.”
Hendricks pushes off the wall.
He walks past the leader. Past the woman.
He doesn’t look at her. He doesn’t signal. He just heads for the next flight of stairs, his boots heavy on the concrete.
She can only watch him go. She understands. He tried to leave her in the apartment. Now he’s succeeding.
“Hold it, shiny.”
The leader steps in front of her. Up close, he smells of smoke and unwashed skin. He raises the scanner.
The red light washes over her.
Silence.
No beep. No tone.
The leader frowns. Shakes the scanner. Hits it against his palm. Scans again.
Nothing.
“Ghost,” he mutters. “Reads empty. Full empty.”
The mood in the stairwell shifts. The boredom vanishes. The three of them circle her, their eyes narrowing.
“No hum,” the wire-thin woman says, leaning in close. “No scar. No history.” She pokes a dirty finger into the woman’s shoulder. “What are ya?”
She doesn’t answer. She doesn’t have one.
“Scan broken?” the third one asks.
“Scan’s fine,” the leader growls. “She hidin’ in there. She standard issue, she is.”
He grabs her hand—the left one, the ruined one. Squeezes the split palm.
The woman watches him do it. She feels the pressure. The damage. But she doesn’t scream. Doesn’t pull away. Just watches him with clear, steady eyes.
“Standard issue doesn’t flinch,” the leader says. Squeezes harder. Blood wells up between his fingers. “Doesn’t feel. Toy? Doll?”
“Softin’ time,” the woman says, drawing a serrated knife. “Open the hood. See what rattles.”
“Hey.”
The voice comes from below. Quiet. Flat.
The scavengers turn.
Hendricks is standing on the landing, two flights down. He is shaking so hard he has to lean against the wall. He looks gray, like a man already dead.
“One chance,” he says, coughs.
The leader laughs. “Go sleep, old man. Before we clip you for real.”
Hendricks doesn’t budge. The leader notices and turns his full attention to him.
“One chance, he says,” the leader sings as he starts to walk towards the old man. “I don’t think he think too good.”
The leader pulls out a magpulse from his leg holster. The others flank him. Three magpulses whirr to charge.
“You was saying?” The leader raises his weapon and points it at Hendricks. He stops trembling. “How about you screwed your one chance. Now you’re meat.”
Hendricks’ hand moves.
It shouldn’t be possible. He’s shaking. He’s dying. But the movement bypasses whatever’s failing in him—muscle memory from before she was born, from before the scars on these walls, from a time when men carried weapons like this and knew what they meant.
Three shots from a hammer fanned as many times.
The sound is enormous. Thunder trapped in concrete.
The leader’s head snaps back. He drops.
The scavenger woman spins, a hole in her chest. She folds.
The third one sits down hard, looking at the red spreading across his stomach. He opens his mouth to say something. Doesn’t.
Hendricks stands there. Smoke curls from the barrel. He spins the revolver from the trigger guard into his holster, the sound of metal settling into leather.
Then he hits the wall. Slides down. His legs fold under him and he sits there, slumped against the graffiti, chest heaving.
Those three shots were everything he had left.
There are two rounds left. There were six.
The woman looks at the bodies.
The first one has no face. The second is crumpled on her side, still. The third is sitting against the railing, staring at something she can’t see.
She looks at Hendricks.
His eyes are closed. His breathing is wrong—shallow, fast, like something is broken inside.
She walks to him. Kneels.
“You came back,” she says.
He opens one eye. Glassy.
“We’re leaving,” he whispers.
He tries to stand. Can’t.
The woman looks at his hands. They’re shaking too hard to grip anything. She looks at the stairs descending into the dark.
She reaches down. Grabs his jacket.
Her hands scream—the torn palms, the missing nails, the damage that should make this impossible. She pulls anyway. Gets him upright. Pulls his arm over her shoulder.
He’s heavy. She takes the weight. Her legs shake. Her arms burn. But she holds.
He is a liability. He is also the only person who knows where they’re going.
She adjusts her grip.
They descend.
