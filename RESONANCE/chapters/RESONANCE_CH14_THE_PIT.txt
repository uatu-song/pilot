**Chapter 14: The Pit**
**POV:** Standard
**Tense:** Present

---

The gray panels end.
Standard notices the moment they cross the threshold — one step she is in silence, the next she is in sound. The walls here are raw concrete, slick with moisture that catches the dim light. The ceiling presses low, crowded with black conduits that vibrate with something she can feel in her teeth.
Elena moves differently now. Shoulders tight. Her hand wrapped around a weapon Standard doesn't recognize — black, angular, humming faintly. She checks corners with a rhythmic turn of her head. Left. Right. Left. The pattern doesn't vary.
Standard follows at three feet. She has learned this distance. Close enough to respond. Far enough not to crowd.
The floor slopes downward. The air grows colder with each step — she feels it first on her bare feet, then climbing her ankles, her calves. Her breath becomes visible. Small ghosts that form and die in the space between heartbeats.
They do not speak.

---

The descent takes four minutes. Standard counts the seconds the way she counted rivets, breaths, heartbeats. It gives her something to hold.
The conduits multiply as they go deeper. They branch and merge like veins, black against the sweating stone, and the vibration in them grows stronger. Not the hum in her chest — something else. Something industrial. The bones of a building that is still alive.
Elena stops at a door.
It is iron. Heavy. The rust on its surface is the color of dried blood. There is a bolt — a thick bar of metal seated in brackets — and Elena reaches for it with both hands.
The sound when she pulls it is a violence.
Metal screaming against metal. It echoes down the corridor behind them, up into the conduits above. Standard feels it in her spine, in the thing below her heart. The hum in her chest shudders, then steadies.
Elena freezes. Listens.
Nothing answers.
She pulls the door open. The hinges shriek. She doesn't wait for the sound to fade — she is already through, weapon raised, and Standard follows.

---

The Pit.
Standard stops at the edge and looks down.
It is circular. Twenty feet deep, maybe more. The walls are curved stone, slick with something that glows faintly green — algae, she thinks, or something that wants to be algae. A metal grating spans the bottom, suspended over dark water she can hear but not see. The drip of condensation echoes upward, each drop magnified by the cistern's shape.
Drip.
Drip.
Drip.
The light comes from a single lamp mounted high on the wall. Sodium-vapor. It casts everything in jaundiced orange — the stone, the water, the figure at the center of the grating.
Hendricks.
He is not sitting. He is held upright by straps — thick leather around his chest and under his arms, anchored to chains that disappear into the darkness above. His feet barely touch the metal. His head hangs forward. He is shirtless, and the bandages wrapped around his torso are yellowed, stiff, crusted with something that has dried and darkened.
Standard looks at him the way she looked at the walls of her cell. The way she looked at her own hands.
She catalogs.
The shallow rise of his chest — too fast, too shallow. The sweat on his ribs catching the orange light. The way his fingers hang limp, the skin around his wrists raw where the straps have rubbed. The smell that rises from him — sharp iron, sweet rot, something underneath that she doesn't have a word for.
He is dying. She knows this the way she knows the room is cold. It is a fact. It sits in her mind without weight.
Elena is already moving. There is a ladder — metal rungs bolted into the curved wall — and she descends fast, her boots ringing against each step. Standard follows. The rungs are slick with the same grit that coats the walls. It feels like wet velvet and sandpaper under her palms.
At the bottom, the grating shifts under their weight. Standard hears water slosh beneath them — black water, still water, water that smells of standing and waiting.
Elena crosses to Hendricks. Her hands reach for the buckles on the brace.
"Hendricks. Hendricks."
He doesn't respond. His head hangs. His breathing doesn't change.
Elena's fingers find the first buckle. It is rusted, fused, and she pries at it with her nails. Her hands are shaking. Standard can see the tremor from three feet away.
"Come on. Come on—"
The buckle gives. Elena reaches for the second one.
Her hand slips. She digs in. Pulls.
Something tears.
Elena makes a sound — short, sharp, bitten off. She pulls her hand back. Blood wells from her finger, dark in the orange light. The nail is gone. Red drops fall to the grating, slip through the gaps, disappear into the black water below.
She doesn't stop. She reaches for the buckle again, blood smearing the leather, and she pulls.
"Hendricks."
Standard watches. The hum in her chest is quiet now — not gone, just listening. She feels it lean toward the man in the straps the way it leaned toward the wall of her cell. Attentive. Waiting.
Elena gets the second buckle open. She reaches for the chest strap.
Her hand touches his skin.
Hendricks surges.
It is not waking. It is convulsion — his whole body jerking against the straps, the chains above screaming as they take his sudden weight. His eyes snap open but they don't see. His mouth opens but no sound comes out. He thrashes, and Elena stumbles back, and the grating shudders beneath them all.
"Hendricks!" Elena grabs his face. Both hands, blood and all. She holds him still. "It's me. It's Elena. Stop. Stop."
He stops.
His breathing is ragged. His eyes find her face. For a moment, he doesn't seem to know what he's looking at.
Then: "Elena."
His voice is a ruin. Dry. Cracked. It sounds like something that hasn't been used in days.
"We're getting you out." Elena is already back at the straps, working the chest buckle. "Can you walk?"
"Don't know." He blinks. His eyes move past her. Find Standard. "She's here."
"She's with me."
"No." Hendricks shakes his head. The motion costs him — Standard can see the pain move through his body like a wave. "She's here. In the compound. They'll know."
"We have twelve minutes before rotation. Less now. Can you walk?"
The chest strap releases. Hendricks slumps forward. Elena catches him — barely, her shoulder under his arm, her legs buckling under his weight. He is taller than her. Heavier. Broken.
Standard moves.
She doesn't decide to move. Her body crosses the distance and her shoulder slides under Hendricks' other arm and she takes his weight the way she would take a bag or a tool. He is heavier than she expected. Or maybe not. She doesn't have a baseline for what bodies should weigh.
Hendricks turns his head. Looks at her. His eyes are glassy with fever but something in them sharpens.
"You," he says. "You're still—"
"Not now." Elena is already moving, dragging them both toward the ladder. "We go. Now."
"Can't climb." Hendricks' voice is flat. Assessment, not complaint. "Not like this."
His hand moves to his hip. Finds nothing. His fingers curl around empty air.
"The gun," he says. "Where—"
"Armory. Other side of the compound." Elena's voice is tight. "We don't have time."
"It's the only thing that—"
"I know what it is." Elena cuts him off. "We have eleven minutes. Maybe ten. It's you or the gun, Hendricks. Pick."
He doesn't answer. His hand stays at his hip for a moment longer — reaching for something that isn't there — then drops.
Elena stops. Looks at the ladder. Looks at him. The calculation moves across her face — Standard can see it, even if she doesn't understand it.
"There." Hendricks tilts his head. The motion is small, exhausted. He is pointing at the corner of the cistern. At the shadows pooled there, thick and black in the orange light.
Standard looks.
It isn't shadow. It is a grate — iron bars over a dark opening in the curved wall. The bars are rusted. One is missing entirely.
"Drainage," Hendricks says. "Leads outside. Saw it when they brought me down."
Elena stares at the grate. At Hendricks. At Standard.
"That's a four-foot crawl. In the dark. With him."
"Yes."
"Through drainage."
"Yes."
Elena closes her eyes. Opens them. The fear is still there, under the soldier, but she is already moving toward the corner. Standard moves with her, Hendricks' weight shifting between them, and the grating groans beneath their steps.
They reach the corner. Elena kneels. She grabs the rusted bars and pulls.
Nothing.
She pulls again. Her torn finger leaves blood on the iron. She braces her feet and pulls with her whole body.
The grate screams — that same violence of metal on stone — and comes free. The opening behind it is black. Absolute. It smells like wet earth and old water and something else, something that moves.
Elena looks at Standard.
"You first. Pull him through. I'll push."
Standard looks at the hole. At the dark. At Hendricks, whose head is lolling, whose breath is shallow and fast, whose body is a weight she is already holding.
The hum in her chest pulses. Once.
She thinks of the cell. The silence. The word she swallowed that she still can't pronounce. She thinks of the woman with tired eyes, reaching out, offering something she couldn't receive.
"Okay," she says.
She lowers herself into the dark. The concrete is wet against her back, her shoulders, her bare feet. The smell is thick — rot and iron and earth. She reaches up.
Elena feeds Hendricks into the hole. His weight settles onto Standard's chest, her stomach, her legs. He groans — a low, animal sound that doesn't have words in it.
"Go," Elena whispers. "I'm right behind you."
Standard pushes backward. Into the dark. Into the drainage tunnel that leads outside, to the compound's edge, to whatever comes next.
The hum in her chest is steady now. Patient.
She doesn't know where she's going. She doesn't know if they'll make it. She doesn't know what waits on the other side.
But she is moving. She is carrying him. And somewhere above them, the drip of condensation continues its count.
Drip.
Drip.
Drip.
