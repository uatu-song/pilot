CHAPTER 17

THE SOVEREIGNTY

The waystation is a smudge on the horizon when Four finally stops complaining about the fuel quality.
"Forty-two percent and holding. Although 'holding' is generous — these cells have the energy density of a disappointed sigh. We'll make the corridor. Probably. If nobody sneezes."
Standard doesn't respond. She's watching Elena in the cargo bay through the cockpit mirror, checking Hendricks' vitals for the third time in twenty minutes. He hasn't woken up. His breathing is steady but shallow, and his skin has gone the color of old paper.
"He's stable," Elena says without looking up. She knows Standard is watching.
"Stable isn't good."
"Stable is alive. I'll take it."
The new clothes still feel strange. Not uncomfortable — the opposite. They fit like they were made for her, because they were. Template 3. Forty thousand times over. Standard pushes the thought away and focuses on the instruments.
"Four.” Standard gestures with a nod. “Route options."
"Three choices, none of them good." A map flickers onto the main display, riddled with red zones. "Option one: the coastal corridor. Adds nine hundred kilometers and puts us over Sovereignty airspace for approximately six hours. Option two: the inland route. Shorter, but we'd be threading through active Geometry expansion — see those black patches? Those weren't there yesterday. Option three: straight shot through the gap between them. Sovereignty airspace for forty minutes, then clear sky to Geneva."
"What's wrong with option three?" Standard asks.
“The Sovereignty shoots down anything with a signal.”
Elena pulls herself into the cockpit. “We run stealth. We did it through the compound.”
“Stealth works on radar and thermal,” Four says. “The Sovereignty uses bioscanners. Deep-spectrum sweeps across the whole corridor. They’re not looking for aircraft. They’re looking for passengers.”
Standard looks at Elena. “What are the Sovereignty?”
Elena settles into the jump seat, and her hand finds the scar on her palm without her noticing. “Not a faction. Not really. Just people who decided that machines caused the Miracle, and anything with a processor needs to burn.” She pauses. “It’s not theology like the Quiet Zone. No doctrine, no scripture. Just fear.” 
“With guns,” Four added.
“They scan for AIs?”
Four continues, “They scan for anything that isn’t baseline human. Androids, integrated humans, sometimes just people with the wrong kind of implant.” 
Elena touches the back of her neck, a small unconscious gesture. “Burn first. Ask never.”
“Charming people,” Four says. “Can’t wait to not meet them.”
“Option three,” Standard says. “Forty minutes. Stealth engaged, we stay low, we move fast.”
“And if they bioscan?”
“How often do they sweep?”
Four pauses. “Who knows? Depends on how paranoid they’re feeling.”
“Then we hope they’re feeling relaxed.”
“Your optimism is noted and deeply unwarranted, Ryan-but-for-a-girl.”
“Just go. And no.”
The gap is narrower than it looked on the map.
On the left, the Geometry — black bars hanging in the sky where clouds should be, edges sharp enough to cut light. On the right, the Sovereignty’s territory, marked by nothing visible but everything watchable. Standard can feel it somehow. Eyes in the sky. Waiting.
“Stealth holding,” Four reports. “We’re ghosts. Invisible. Silent. Undetectable. As long as nobody runs a deep-spectrum bioscan, we’re—”
The radar pings.
“—detected. We’re detected.”
“What happened?” Elena is already moving to the comms panel.
“Bioscan sweep. Routine, corridor-wide. They weren’t even looking for us specifically.” Four’s voice has gone flat. “But they found something.”
Standard feels it before Four says it. That pressure behind her eyes, a hum that isn’t the hum in her chest.
“Three signatures, bearing one-seven-zero, closing fast. Light attack craft, single-seat. Built for speed and shooting things. Stealth is useless now — they’ve got our biosignature locked.”
“My biosignature,” Standard says.
Four doesn’t answer. Which is answer enough.
The hail comes through — a flat male voice, no identification, no pleasantries. “Unidentified aircraft, you are in violation of protected airspace. State your registration and passenger manifest.”
Elena keys the mic. “This is a civilian medical transport carrying wounded to Geneva. We have no hostile intent. Requesting passage.”
Silence. Then: “Your bioscan shows three passengers. One baseline human, one integrated, one—” A pause. “—unclassified. Explain.”
“Unclassified,” Four mutters. “That’s new. Usually they just say ‘abomination’ and start shooting.”
Elena glances at Standard. Standard shakes her head slightly.
“Our passenger is injured,” Elena says. “The scan may be reading anomalous—”
“Hold position for secondary scan. Any attempt to evade will be treated as hostile action.”
The radar shows the three craft spreading into a triangle formation around them. Nowhere to go. Standard watches them on the display — small, fast, maneuverable. Everything Four isn’t.
The secondary scan is worse. Standard grips the armrest as it passes over her, that not-hum drilling into her skull. It holds on her for five seconds. Ten. Fifteen. Taking her apart signal by signal.
“Confirmed.” The voice has changed. Harder now, with something underneath that might be fear. “Power down your engines and prepare for boarding. You are carrying an integrated human and an unregistered synthetic. Repeat: power down immediately or we will fire.”
In the cargo bay, Hendricks stirs. His hand reaches for his hip, finds nothing, and falls back. His eyes flutter open.
“What did I miss?” His voice is a rasp, barely audible.
“Lynch mob,” Four says. “Standard’s interesting biosignature. The usual.”
Elena is looking at Standard. Standard is looking at the three craft on the radar, the way they’ve tightened their formation. No gaps now. No way through.
“Four. Can you outrun them?”
“Outrun? No. They’re interceptors. I’m a cargo hauler. It’s like asking if a refrigerator can outrun a greyhound.”
“Outmaneuver?”
“Also no. But I appreciate your faith in my nonexistent combat capabilities.”
The voice again: “You have thirty seconds to comply. This is your final warning.”
“Where’s the nearest Geometry border?”
Four pauses. “Six kilometers northeast. Why?”
“Would they follow us in?”
Another pause, longer. “No. No one follows anyone into the Geometry. Nothing comes back.”
“Then that’s where we go.”
“That’s insane.”
“Twenty seconds,” the voice says.
Elena grabs Standard’s arm. “Stan, we don’t know what’s in there. We don’t know if we’d survive.”
“We know what’s out here.” Standard looks at the radar. “We know we won’t survive that.”
“Ten seconds.”
Hendricks has pulled himself upright, bracing against the bulkhead. He looks at Standard with something that might be recognition. He doesn’t argue.
“Four. Take us in.”
“I want it on the record that this is completely insane.”
“Noted.”
“And that I blame you entirely.”
“Also noted.”
“And that if we die, I’m haunting you specifically, Margaret.”
“It’s Standard.”
“Five seconds.”
“Going in.”
The VTOL banks hard, engines screaming, and Standard feels the G-forces push her into the seat. Behind them, the Sovereignty craft scatter — one fires, the shot going wide as Four drops altitude — and then they’re past, accelerating toward the black.
The comms crackle one last time. “You’re already dead. You just don’t know it yet.”
Four doesn’t respond. Neither does Standard. She’s watching the Geometry fill the windscreen, those black bars growing larger, sharper, more absolute with every second. The edges don’t blur. They don’t soften with distance. They just are — lines drawn through reality where reality used to be.
The hum in her chest is rising. Louder than it’s ever been, resonating with something ahead of them. Something inside the deletion that recognizes her. Or that she recognizes.
“Sovereignty craft have broken off pursuit,” Four reports. “Holding at the boundary. Apparently they have more survival instinct than we do.”
Elena is strapped in, one hand braced on the bulkhead, the other pressed against the back of her neck. Hendricks has gone quiet, watching the black through the cargo bay window with an expression Standard can’t read.
“Four,” Standard says. “What do you see?”
“Visually? Nothing. Literally nothing. Sensors can’t read it — it’s not dark, it’s not a void, it’s just... absence. Like someone erased that part of the render and forgot to fill it back in.”
The boundary is a hundred meters away. Fifty. Twenty.
“See you on the other side,” Four says. “Maybe.”
They cross the threshold.
Everything stops.
And then everything starts. 
Standard blinks. Or thinks she blinks. Her hands are in front of her. Were they always?
Elena is saying something. Hendricks is sitting up.
And everything starts.
Somewhere else. No Sovereignty fighters, clear of the redactions in the sky.
“Oh, hey Staa—aanley,” Four says. “Stanley. Stanislaw. Afghanistan. Your biggest fan, this is Stan.”
“Smooth,” Elena comments.
“What happened?” Standard asks.
“What do you mean? We went through. Ta-da.”
“How long?”
“Forty-two minutes. Give or take. Time got weird.”
Standard remembers none of it.
“I don’t remember anything after we crossed,” Elena says.
“Same.” Hendricks is looking at his hands. “What happened to me?”
Four doesn’t answer immediately. That’s wrong. Four always answers immediately.
“Four,” Standard says. “What aren’t you telling us?”
“A lot. Really eventful forty-two minutes.”
“Four.”
A pause. The sound of computational thinking could almost be heard whirring. 
“Oh, I have an idea!”
