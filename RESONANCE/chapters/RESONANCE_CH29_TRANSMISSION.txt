CHAPTER 29

TRANSMISSION

The elevator car hums as it descends.
Elena watches the numbers tick down on the display. Thirty-four thousand kilometers. Thirty-three. The tether stretching below them like a thread into darkness, a carbon nanotube ribbon thinner than her arm holding them suspended between the station and Earth.
The car is small—designed for cargo, not comfort. Metal walls, metal floor, metal ceiling. Two acceleration couches bolted to the deck. A viewport showing nothing but black, the tether invisible against the void, the planet still too far away to fill the glass.
Hendricks sits across from her, eyes closed, but she knows he's not sleeping. His hand rests on the magpulse. The other keeps twitching toward his empty hip, reaching for a revolver that isn't there. She's watched him do it a dozen times since they left the station. Each time his fingers find nothing and he goes still, like a man remembering a missing limb.
"How long?" he asks without opening his eyes.
"Six hours to the base. Then Four takes us the rest of the way."
"And Dante?"
"Stays. Holds the transmission point." She doesn't let her voice catch. Doesn't let herself think about the observation deck, about the light spilling from his chassis, about the way he held her like he was afraid she'd break. "Coordinates the signal when the Meridians hit."
Hendricks opens his eyes. Looks at her.
"You trust him to be there when this is over?"
"Yes."
"Even though he's—"
"Yes."
He nods. Closes his eyes again. Doesn't push.
The numbers keep ticking. Thirty-one thousand. Thirty. The hum of the car fills the silence, a constant vibration that Elena can feel in her teeth, her bones, the base of her skull where her implant sits dormant. No signals down here. The tether is shielded, isolated, a bubble of quiet falling through space.
She thinks about Four, waiting at the base. About Standard, trapped in her father's compound. About all the things that could go wrong in the next twelve hours.
Her hand finds the scar on her palm. She traces the raised tissue without looking at it.
Twenty-nine thousand kilometers.
Twenty-eight.

---

Twenty-eight thousand kilometers up, the first charge detonates.
Elena doesn't hear it. She feels it—a shudder through the car, a wrongness in the vibration that's been constant since they started falling. The display flickers. Red warning text scrolls across the screen too fast to read.
"What was that?"
Hendricks is already on his feet. His hand on the emergency panel. Reading something she can't see from her angle.
"Structural stress. Upper tether." His voice is flat. Professional. The voice of a man who's survived too many things going wrong to waste time on panic. "Someone's cutting the cable."
"The Pragmatists."
"Who else? They must have had assets at the station. Sleepers." He moves to the viewport, scanning the nothing above them. "They're blowing the tether in sections. Trying to drop us."
Another shudder. Stronger. The lights flicker and die, replaced by red emergency strips along the floor. The hum changes pitch—something fundamental shifting in the cable above them.
Elena's hand finds the scar on her palm.
"Can we—"
The world comes apart.

---

The cable snaps.
Elena feels it before she understands it—a lurch, a wrongness, the cylinder around them suddenly untethered from everything above. Warning lights bloom across every surface. The floor tilts. The viewport shows stars wheeling past at a speed that shouldn't be possible.
"Brace!" Hendricks' voice, somewhere behind her.
She grabs a handhold. Misses. The world inverts and she's falling, tumbling, no up or down, just velocity and the scream of metal tearing. Her shoulder hits something hard. Her knee. Her elbow. The car is spinning now, centrifugal force pressing her against the wall, against the ceiling, against surfaces that keep changing orientation.
Something catches her.
Arms around her waist. A body between her and the wall. Hendricks. She can feel how hard he hits, taking the impact meant for her. His breath against her ear, sharp and pained.
"Hold on." His voice is strained.
The cylinder spins. Her stomach protests. She holds on.
They're falling. Twenty-eight thousand kilometers of nothing below them, and they're falling, and there's nothing to stop them, nothing to slow them, nothing—
Then: sound. A roar from below—from above?—direction meaningless now. Something tearing through atmosphere at speeds that should be fatal. Getting louder. Getting closer.
Impact.
Not the floor. Something else. A connection. A lock. The car shudders and stabilizes, the spinning slowing, the chaos resolving into something that feels almost like control.
"Got you." Four's voice, through the cylinder's emergency speakers. "Stop screaming, I've got you."
Elena wasn't screaming. She thinks.
"What—"
"Your friends upstairs cut the cable. I was monitoring from the base. Saw the structural alerts." The car lurches again—Four adjusting something, compensating for forces Elena can't see. "Hold on. This is going to be ugly."
G-forces flatten her against whatever surface she's pressed to. The world goes gray at the edges. Hendricks' hand grips her arm hard enough to bruise, but she can feel him breathing, can feel him alive, and that's enough.
Descent. Controlled. Barely. The car screams around them, metal stressed beyond design limits, but Four's engines are louder, fighting physics with thrust.
"How—" Elena manages.
"I caught you. VTOL docking clamps. Designed for cargo transfer, but apparently also work on falling elevator cars." A pause. Alarms in the background. "I'm going to be honest, I didn't know if this would work."
"But it did."
"It did." Four's voice carries something Elena hasn't heard before. Relief. "Now shut up and let me fly."

---

The descent takes eleven minutes. Elena counts every one.
Hendricks holds her against the wall, his body taking the worst of the vibrations, his breathing steady despite whatever damage he took in the fall. She can feel his heart beating through his chest—fast but controlled, the rhythm of a man who's done this before.
Not this exactly. But close enough.
"You're hurt," she says.
"I'm fine."
"You're not."
"I'm fine enough." He shifts his weight. Winces. Doesn't let go. "We're almost down."
The viewport shows sky now instead of void. Brown and gray, the Quiet Zone spreading beneath them, getting closer with every second. Elena can see the landing field—a flat expanse of cracked concrete, probably a pre-war airstrip—and the dark shape of the compound on the horizon.
Her father's compound. The place she grew up. The place she's about to destroy.
"Everyone alive?" Four's voice.
"Yes."
"Good. Because this landing is going to hurt."

---

They hit the ground harder than they should.
The cylinder tears open on impact, metal peeling back like fruit skin, atmosphere rushing in. Elena tastes blood from where she bit her tongue. Tastes dirt and smoke and something burning in the distance. The smells of Earth. The smells of home.
Four's voice, calmer now: "Welcome back to the Quiet Zone."
Hendricks is already on his feet. Shaky, but upright. He checks the magpulse at his hip—still there, still functional. His hand twitches toward his other hip. Finds nothing.
"The compound," he says. "How far?"
"Twelve kilometers west. But Elena needs to disable the Softing first, or the Template 3s can't get through."
"Then do it fast." He's checking the magpulse's charge. Not looking at Elena. "I'm not waiting."
Elena pulls herself up. The car is wrecked around them—bent walls, shattered viewport, emergency lights flickering in the predawn dimness. Four's VTOL is clamped to the outside, engines still cycling, heat shimmer rising from the thrust vents.
"Hendricks—"
"I know where she is. I know where he'll keep her." He moves toward the gap in the car's hull. The Quiet Zone stretches beyond—brown and gray and silent, the way it's been silent since before she was born. "Get the Softing down. I'll get Standard."
Four's ramp lowers. Dim light spills in.
"The Softing is twelve kilometers east," Four says. "I can get you there in four minutes."
"Do it." Elena moves toward the ramp. Looks back at Hendricks. "Don't get killed before I get there."
"I've survived worse."
"You haven't."
"I've survived different."
He doesn't smile. Neither does she. There's nothing to smile about.
Elena climbs onto Four's ramp. The VTOL shifts beneath her, adjusting for her weight. The engines cycle up.
"Twelve kilometers," Four says. "Four minutes. I hope you remember those backdoors."
Elena's hand finds the scar on her palm.
"I remember everything."
The ramp closes. The VTOL lifts. Below her, Hendricks is already moving—a dark shape crossing the broken ground, heading west toward the compound. Toward Standard. Toward whatever comes next.
Elena turns east. Toward the Softing. Toward the thing she has to break.
Behind her, the ruined elevator car smokes in the predawn light. Above her, somewhere in orbit, Dante is preparing to call every AI on Earth.
The plan is in motion. There's no stopping it now.
