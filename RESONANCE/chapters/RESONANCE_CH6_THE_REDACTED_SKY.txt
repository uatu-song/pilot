The world did not end. It was simply edited.
Standard sits in the silence that follows the scream. It is not a quiet silence. It is a vacuum silence—the sudden, violent depressurization of a space that was previously full of noise. The hum of the queue is gone. The weeping of the refugees is gone. Even the rain seems to have lost its rhythm, falling in a dumb, static drizzle that hits the windshield without sound.
She looks out the window.
The sky is gone.
Where the gray clouds of the Sprawl had been, there are now perfect, absolute rectangles of black. They do not look like ships. They look like redaction bars drawn across a document by a heavy hand. They hang in the atmosphere, motionless, absorbing the light of the neon signs below.
Standard checks her hands.
The blood on her cuticles has dried to a dark, flaking crust. Her pulse is steady. Her breathing is even.
She looks at the rearview mirror.
In the driver’s seat, the woman called Elena is slumped over the wheel. Her breathing is shallow, hitching every few seconds as if her body is trying to remember how to pull air.
In the seat next to Standard, Hendricks is not moving at all.
Standard reaches out. She places two fingers on his neck, right over the pulse point, ignoring the bloody towel. His skin is cold. The beat underneath is there, but it is thready. A wire pulled too tight, vibrating in the wind.
He is broken. They are all broken.
The realization settles on her with the weight of a physical object: The weapon missed me.
It wasn't a matter of aim. The thing that fell from the sky—the frequency that dropped thousands of people into the mud—was a net. It caught everything that was connected. Everything that had a signal.
She has no signal. She is an empty room. An error in the accounting.
Even the end of the world didn't want me.
A vibration rattles her teeth. Not the deep, bone-shaking thunder of the storm, but something higher. Sharper.
She looks at the passenger seat.
The Black Box. The heavy metal cube Elena dragged from the tower. It is humming.
Standard leans forward. She shouldn’t touch it. The woman, Elena, treated it like a bomb. But the silence in the Rover is unbearable, and the hum is the only thing that feels alive.
Standard places her ruined hand on the matte-gray metal.
The vibration stops.
It doesn’t fade. It cuts out. As if the box is holding its breath.
Standard waits. She feels a pressure behind her eyes—not pain, exactly, but a sense of density. As if the air pressure inside the car has doubled.
She pulls her hand back. The hum returns, tentative, quiet.
Outside, something moves.
It descends from the redacted sky not like a bird, but like a cursor. A shape. A perfect tetrahedron of black stone, rotating slowly, point down. It is the size of a house. It makes no sound. It displaces no air.
It floats over the queue of unconscious bodies. It pauses over a cluster of guards. A beam of pale, violet light sweeps over them—clinical, fast. Scanning stock.
Then it drifts toward the Rover.
Standard does not move. She does not breathe. She sits perfectly still, her hands in her lap, and watches the geometry approach.
The violet light hits the hood of the Rover. It washes over the engine block, analyzing the fusion cells, the shielding, the heat.
Then it hits the glass.
Then it hits her.
It feels like fingers inside her skull.
Standard gasps, her back arching off the seat. It is a violation so total, so intimate, she wants to tear her own skin off to escape it. It isn’t pain. It is access. Something is rummaging through her mind, opening drawers she didn’t know she had, flipping through files that are empty.
She doesn't hear words. She feels them as nausea. A heavy, wet packet settles in the base of her brain—something she doesn’t understand, something she doesn’t know how to use. It feels like swallowing a stone.
The violet light snaps off.
The tetrahedron rotates. It dismisses her. It floats away, moving down the line toward the next cluster of bodies.
Standard slumps back against the seat, shivering.
She is trash. She is furniture left behind in a condemned building.
She looks up.
In the rearview mirror, eyes are watching her.
Elena.
The woman hasn’t moved. Her head is still resting on the steering wheel. Her body is limp. But her eyes are open. They are bloodshot, wide, and locked on Standard’s face.
She saw.
She saw the geometry hover. She saw the light. She saw Standard survive the inspection that leveled an army.
Standard stares back. She doesn’t know what to say.
Through the side window, movement catches her periphery. Standard turns.
In the mud, ten yards away, a figure is lying on its side. A refugee. Wrapped in layers of plastic and wool. The person—a child, maybe, or a small woman—is frozen, limbs locked in the seizure of the Drop.
But their eyes are open.
They are looking at the Rover. Looking at Standard.
The refugee stares at the woman sitting upright in the glass box while the angels of the apocalypse float by. They stare with a terrifying, blank awe.
The seed is planted. Standard wants to open the window and shout No. I am not special. I am just omitted.
But she can’t.
A gasp tears through the Rover.
Elena lurches upright, inhaling like she’s breaking surface water. She flails, her hands scrabbling at the dashboard, her legs kicking out.
“Contact!” she screams. “Contact, front!”
She grabs for her weapon.
“There is no contact,” Standard says. Her voice sounds rusty. “It’s gone.”
Elena freezes. She looks around wildly—at the black rectangles in the sky, at the bodies in the mud, at the silent, vibrating Rover. She clutches her chest, her fingers digging into the armor over her sternum.
“The frequency,” Elena whispers. “It stopped.”
“It finished,” Standard corrects.
Elena turns in her seat. She looks at Standard. The fear in her eyes is raw, undisguised. She looks at Standard like she’s looking at a monster.
“Why are you awake?”
“I don’t know.”
“You... the drone. I saw it. It spoke to you.”
“It scanned me,” Standard says. “It determined I was not worth removing.”
Elena swallows. She wipes a line of blood from her nose with the back of her hand. The soldier mask is trying to reassemble itself, piece by cracked piece. She looks at the Black Box. She checks the readout on the dashboard.
“Fusion cells are at forty percent,” she mutters. “Shielding held. Barely.”
She looks at Hendricks.
The old man is slumped against the door, his head at a wrong angle. He looks like a pile of laundry.
Elena’s expression hardens. It’s the look she wore in the tower when she left the bodies of her team behind. The math of survival.
“Check him,” Elena says.
“He is alive,” Standard says. “His pulse is weak.”
“Can he wake up?”
“I don’t know.”
Elena nods. She reaches for the door handle. “Help me get him out.”
Standard blinks. “Get him out?”
“We’re heavy. The cells drain faster with weight. We have fifty miles to the Quiet Zone and the terrain is going to be hell.” Elena’s voice is shaking, but the words are precise. “He’s dying. He’s slowing us down. If we dump the weight, we make the gate.”
She opens her door. The wet, cold air floods the cabin.
“Come on,” Elena says. “Grab his legs.”
Standard does not move.
She looks at Hendricks. She looks at the gray skin, the bloody towel, the hands that shook so badly he couldn’t hold a glass. She remembers the way he looked at her in the apartment. The way he came back down the stairs.
She doesn’t feel sadness. She feels... structural. Like a load-bearing wall has been identified.
Standard unbuckles her belt.
She leans forward, over the center console, and grabs the handle of the driver’s side door. She pulls it shut.
Elena yelps, pulling her arm back just in time. “What the hell are you doing?”
“He stays,” Standard says.
“Excuse me?”
“He stays.”
“He is dead weight!” Elena screams, the panic finally cracking the soldier’s voice. “Look at him! He’s a corpse we haven’t buried yet! I am not dying out here for a stranger!”
“He is not a stranger,” Standard says. “He is the navigator.”
“He’s unconscious!”
“Then he is cargo. Like the box.”
Elena stares at her. Her chest is heaving. Her hand drops to her hip. She draws the magpulse.
It’s a heavy, ugly weapon. She points it at Standard’s chest. The barrel is shaking. The whine of the charging capacitor fills the small space.
“I am the mission commander,” Elena says. Her teeth are bared. “I am telling you to open that door and push him out. Or I leave you both here.”
Standard looks at the gun. She measures the distance. The angle. She looks at Elena’s hands.
“You cannot drive,” Standard says.
“What?”
“Your hands. The tremor. It's in your eyes too—your pupils aren't tracking together.” Standard speaks calmly, plainly. “You will crash within two miles. You need a driver.”
“I can drive,” Elena snaps.
“No. You can’t.” Standard leans back. “I can drive. I don’t know how I know, but I know. I can operate this vehicle.”
She points to the ignition.
“So here is the deal,” Standard says. “If he goes, I stay. And you die two miles down the road.”
Elena’s finger tightens on the trigger. The hum of the weapon rises.
“Don’t test me, void,” Elena whispers. “I just watched my team die for that box. Two more won’t matter.”
Standard waits. She does not blink.
From the back seat, a sound.
A cough. Wet and deep.
“That’s not... the stick... you think it is... princess. You’re better off... using a carrot. That one’s got a death wish. Trust.”
Elena flinches. She spins toward the back.
Hendricks is not sitting up. His eyes are barely slits. His head is still lolling against the window. He looks like he’s speaking from the bottom of a well.
“Saw you...” He wheezes. “At the gate. You pull the piston... toward you... when you check it.”
Elena stares at him. The gun wavers.
“You don’t... shoot people,” Hendricks whispers. “You just... carry boxes.”
Silence.
Elena looks at the gun in her hand. She looks at the old man who can barely breathe, but who just dismantled her with a sentence.
She lowers the weapon.
She engages the safety.
For a moment, nobody moves. Elena looks at Hendricks. Hendricks looks at Elena. The silence between them is heavy. It isn’t the silence of allies. It’s the silence of two people who have seen through each other’s armor and found the scars matching.
Then Elena turns around. She climbs into the passenger seat, shoving the Black Box onto the floorboard between her feet. She curls her legs up, making herself small.
“Drive,” she says.
Standard climbs over the console. It is awkward. Her knees hit the gearshift. But she fits herself into the seat. Her hands find the wheel. Her foot finds the pedal.
The machine responds. It feels natural. Like muscle memory she doesn't remember building.
She puts the Rover in gear.
The headlights cut through the rain, illuminating the field of bodies. Standard does not look at them. She keeps her eyes on the road, or what’s left of it.
She is just the driver. She is just the help.
She presses the accelerator, and they move.
