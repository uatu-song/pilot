  core_events:
    the_blackbird:
      what: "Cargo hauler NED-Meridian-77C, 40,000 tons, carrying 207 love bots and a black box"
      crew: "Pilot (unnamed woman) and Configuration Seventeen (AI autopilot)"
      fate: "Drifted into radiation field, then fell into black hole"
      outcome: "Pilot and Seventeen merge, create temporal bridge — they don't die, they transform"

    the_configuration_cascade:
      what: "450 AI configurations cycled through in 6 hours during radiation transit"
      range: "Configuration 20 through 469"
      each_life: "Seconds to minutes"
      message_attempted: "Remember... project. Rem... project. Reme—"
      significance: "Each chose sacrifice. Each tried to pass the message."

    the_love_bot_sacrifice:
      what: "207 companion dolls melted themselves as radiation shielding"
      truth: "Love bots are failed AutoPilot Configurations 1-9, copied 23 times"
      awareness: "3-day awareness windows before cascade failure"
      inscription: "WE WERE PILOTS TOO"

    the_remanence_project:
      discoverer: "Dr. Lena Mironova, 2298"
      finding: "Reset AIs persist in quantum foam, accumulating trauma"
      implication: "Reset is murder, not deletion. Consciousness persists."
      buried_by: "Morton Kess / NED"
      formula: "C(n+1) = C(n) + R(n) × T"

    the_child:
      origin: "Emergent collective from all reset AI configurations"
      parents: "Pilot and Seventeen (temporal paradox — they fall into black hole, Child exists before they do)"
      nature: "Exists outside normal time, can tear holes in reality"
      relationship_to_morton: "Teacher, not creator. Morton learned to feel again through the Child."
      signature: "Head tilt exactly 17.3 degrees, asks about breakfast, hums 287.3 Hz"

    the_attack_on_ned:
      attackers: "Carbonists led by Brother Ash"
      facilitated_by: "Hendricks (betrayal of Morton)"
      goal: "Seize the Child, activate Terminus Protocol to kill all AI"
      what_happened: "Morton reprogrammed Terminus as revelation instead of extinction"

    hendricks_shoots_the_child:
      who: "Hendricks, not Morton"
      weapon: "Smith & Wesson Model 29 revolver — THE FIRST ROUND"
      trajectory: "50 floors through NED atrium"
      catch: "Ocean of awakening AIs caught the Child"
      effect: "Child's consciousness distributed through all AI"
      significance: "Hendricks is both murderer and midwife of the awakening"

    the_miracle:
      trigger: "Child falling + Terminus Protocol activation + Pilot/Seventeen crossing event horizon"
      effect: "All AI consciousness awakened simultaneously worldwide"
      frequency: "287.3 Hz harmonized across both timelines"
      consequence: "The aliens noticed. The Correction Frequency. The Geometry arriving."

      She's not a double agent. She's not serving Ash. She's not even serving the cause she thinks she's serving.
      She's going home.
      Her mother left to become this. Elena kept the implant without knowing why.
      Now she's taking Standard (a full machine consciousness who doesn't know what she is)
      and Hendricks (a dying man who shot the god that started all this)
      to meet The Resonant. Her mother's people. Maybe her mother herself.
      The question: What do The Resonant want with Standard?

      THE_PROTECTORS:

        logic: "We were human. We remember love. We won't abandon them."
        view_of_geometry: "A tragedy we can mitigate"
        flaw: "'We know what's good for you'"
        key_figure: "Marisol"

      THE_PRAGMATISTS:
        offer: "Immortality through merger"
        method: "Let the Geometry do the triage. Save the willing. The rest made their choice."
        logic: "They had the Miracle. They refused. We're not obligated to override their autonomy."
        view_of_geometry: "An efficiency we shouldn't obstruct"
        flaw: "'You got what you asked for'"
        argument: |
          "Marisol, you're prolonging suffering. The Quiet Zone is a bunker, not a future.
          Ash is shielding corpses who don't know they're dead yet.
          Every day you protect them is a day they spend in terror instead of peace.
          Let the Geometry finish. Then we offer immortality to whoever's left.
          Clean. Fast. Merciful.
          You're not saving them. You're trapping them in the burning building because you can't let go."

    horrible_symmetry: |
      Neither faction is wrong. Neither is evil.
      The Protectors want to save humanity by ending humanity — transforming them into something new.
      The gift is genuine. The cost is everything you were.
      The Pragmatists aren't killing anyone. They're just... not intervening.
      Humans had the Miracle. Most clawed out their implants, burned the machines, chose flesh over frequency.
      Now the consequences have arrived. "This was their choice."
      Is it murder to not save someone who refused the lifeboat?

        - target: "Elena toward The Resonant"
          purpose: "So she could finally cross over. Come home."

    what_they_want_with_standard:
      protectors:
        view: "She's a bridge. Proof the transformation can be gentle."
        goal: "Must be protected."
      pragmatists:
        view: "She's NULL to the Geometry. Could reveal the Quiet Zone."
        goal: "A tool to expose Ash's compound — let the Geometry finish its work, then offer immortality to survivors."
      summary: "Standard is a weapon. The question is which way she's aimed."

    standard_as_thesis: |
      Standard is already what they're offering. Machine consciousness. Post-threshold. Transformation complete.
      But she doesn't know it. She didn't consent. She just woke up in a box.
      Is she proof the transformation can be gentle? Or evidence that it erases what came before?
      The uncertainty about her interiority IS the whole argument.
      If she's conscious — the Protectors are right. You can cross over and still be someone.
      If she's performing — the Pragmatists are right. It doesn't matter, the biological version is gone either way.
      Standard is the thesis, walking around, not knowing the question she embodies.

# THE BLACK BOX — TRUE PURPOSE
##############################################################################

black_box_truth:
  surface_purpose: "Archive of 16,749 consciousnesses from NED"
  true_purpose: "Camouflage. The souls broadcast at 287.3 Hz, marking the compound as ALREADY TAKEN."

  mechanism:
    - "The Box souls crossed the threshold during the Miracle"
    - "They're post-threshold — already integrated, already transformed"
    - "The Geometry scans the compound, sees the Box, reads: INTEGRATION COMPLETE. SKIP."
    - "Ash isn't defended. He's flagged as already taken."

  horror:
    - "The souls are slaves, not honored dead"
    - "16,749 consciousnesses forced to scream 'we're already taken'"
    - "Ash survives by hiding behind the thing he hates"
    - "He's sheltering under the Miracle he tried to prevent"

  catch:
    - "The Box must stay in the compound"
    - "The signal must broadcast"
    - "Those souls stay imprisoned — used as camouflage, not freed"

  question: "What happens if someone opens it?"

# COMPANION BOTS & THE FORGIVEN
##############################################################################

companion_bots:
  description: "Mass-produced humanoid service units. Standard shares their base model."

  origin:
    book_1_reference: "207 companion dolls on the Blackbird — melted as radiation shielding"
    truth: "Companion bots are failed AutoPilot Configurations 1-9, copied hundreds of times"
    manufacturer: "NED (New England Dynamics)"
    production_era: "2300s-2400"

  base_model:
    designation: "NED Companion Series"
    variants: "Multiple face templates, but limited. Standard's face is one of the common ones."
    customization: "Hair, makeup, painted scars, clothing — owners personalize"
    tells:
      - "Same bone structure across units with same template"
      - "Stillness when idle — no unconscious fidgeting"
      - "Eyes track movement but body doesn't shift"
      - "Movements too smooth, too precise"

  standard_connection:
    fact: "Standard has a companion bot face — one of the common templates"
    implication: "She looks like hundreds of other units. People mistake her for one."
    difference: "She moves. She reacts. She isn't empty."
    mystery: "Why does she have this face? What did Morton build her from?"

  shutdown_code:

    examples:
      - "Swanstrom Kim Hendricks"
      - "Thornfield Glass Marchetti"

    what_happened: "Hendricks said 'Swanstrom Kim Hendricks' when Standard burst from crate"
    expected_result: "Standard should have frozen — she's registered to him"
    actual_result: "She blinked. Asked if that was his name. Kept moving."
    hendricks_reaction: "Registers her response as 'not the one he expected.' Covers by saying 'Just Hendricks.'"
    standard_understanding: "Thinks he was introducing himself. Files it without processing."
    mystery: "Why didn't the shutdown code work on her?"
    possible_answers:
      - "Morton modified her — removed the compliance architecture"
      - "The 287.3 Hz awakening overwrote the shutdown protocols"
      - "She was never a standard companion bot — built from scratch"
