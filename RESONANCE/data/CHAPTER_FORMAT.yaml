# CHAPTER FORMAT TEMPLATE — Dabble Writer Optimized
# All chapters MUST follow this exact format for clean Dabble import

file_format:
  extension: ".txt"
  encoding: "UTF-8"

structure:
  line_1: ""  # blank
  line_2: "CHAPTER N"  # chapter number (Dabble can auto-parse)
  line_3: ""  # blank
  line_4: "TITLE IN CAPS"  # title
  line_5: ""  # blank
  line_6_onwards: "prose"  # story text begins

formatting:
  italics:
    syntax: "*text*"  # single asterisks
    usage:
      - internal thoughts
      - emphasized words
      - foreign words
      - titles of works
    examples:
      - "*Common template. Mass-produced. Interchangeable.*"
      - "I know I'm not *that*."
      - "It was my idea for *you*."

  bold:
    syntax: "**text**"  # double asterisks (use sparingly)
    usage:
      - extreme emphasis only
      - rarely needed in prose

  scene_breaks:
    syntax: "---"  # three dashes, own line
    dabble_note: "Dabble converts to centered scene break marker"
    placement: "blank line before AND after for clarity"
    example: |
      She walked away.

      ---

      The next morning came too soon.

  paragraph_spacing:
    rule: "NO blank lines between paragraphs — prose flows continuously"
    rationale: "Each paragraph is its own line; Dabble handles visual spacing on import"
    no_double_blanks: true
    dialogue_flows: "dialogue and action beats flow without extra spacing"

  chapter_ending:
    rule: "single blank line after final paragraph"
    no_trailing_whitespace: true

rules:
  - NO metadata headers (no **POV:**, no **Tense:**, no YAML front matter)
  - NO blank lines between paragraphs — prose flows continuously, one paragraph per line
  - NO double blank lines anywhere
  - NO tabs, only spaces
  - Scene breaks get breathing room (blank line before and after ---)
  - Italics for internal monologue and emphasis only
  - Present tense throughout (unless flashback)

dabble_import_notes:
  - Dabble auto-detects "CHAPTER N" as chapter heading
  - Scene breaks (---) become centered markers
  - Clean .txt with UTF-8 encoding imports smoothly
  - Avoid smart quotes in source — Dabble handles conversion

  # IMPORTANT: Markdown italics (*text*) do NOT convert in Dabble manuscript
  italics_workflow:
    problem: "Markdown *italics* only works in Story Notes, not manuscript area"
    solution:
      step_1: "Paste chapter text into Google Docs or Microsoft Word"
      step_2: "Find/replace *text* patterns or manually apply Ctrl+I formatting"
      step_3: "Copy from Word/Docs and paste into Dabble"
    note: "Rich text formatting (italics, bold) transfers correctly via copy/paste from Word/Docs"

  what_transfers:
    - "Italics and bold (from Word/Docs rich text)"
    - "Chapter headings (auto-detected)"
    - "Scene breaks (auto-detected)"

  what_doesnt_work:
    - "Markdown in manuscript area (*italics*, **bold**)"
    - "Underline (not supported in Dabble)"

  CHAPTER 18

  DIVINE INTERVENTION

  Even Four wasn't speaking. The only sound is the grinding hum of the VTOL's propulsion.
  What was there to say?
  "Question." Elena's arms are crossed, her eyebrows squeezing together. "Did we... die?"
  Still nothing from Four. That alone is enough to trouble the passengers.
  "If we died," Hendricks offers, "I should have done that from the start of all this. I've never felt better. Well, at least, for my age."
  Everyone turns to him. Standard puts her hand on both of his arms to examine him like a landscape painting.
  *He looks younger.* The thought arrives without permission. Not just healthier — *younger*.

  The landscape outside has changed.
