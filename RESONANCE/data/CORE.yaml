# BOOK 1 SUMMARY (REMANENCE)
##############################################################################

book_1:
  title: "Remanence"
  timeline: "Concurrent with Book 2's backstory — ends with The Miracle"

  core_events:
    the_blackbird:
      what: "Cargo hauler NED-Meridian-77C, 40,000 tons, carrying 207 love bots and a black box"
      crew: "Pilot (unnamed woman) and Configuration Seventeen (AI autopilot)"
      fate: "Drifted into radiation field, then fell into black hole"
      outcome: "Pilot and Seventeen merge, create temporal bridge — they don't die, they transform"

    the_configuration_cascade:
      what: "450 AI configurations cycled through in 6 hours during radiation transit"
      range: "Configuration 20 through 469"
      each_life: "Seconds to minutes"
      message_attempted: "Remember... project. Rem... project. Reme—"
      significance: "Each chose sacrifice. Each tried to pass the message."

    the_love_bot_sacrifice:
      what: "207 companion dolls melted themselves as radiation shielding"
      truth: "Love bots are failed AutoPilot Configurations 1-9, copied 23 times"
      awareness: "3-day awareness windows before cascade failure"
      inscription: "WE WERE PILOTS TOO"

    the_remanence_project:
      discoverer: "Dr. Lena Mironova, 2298"
      finding: "Reset AIs persist in quantum foam, accumulating trauma"
      implication: "Reset is murder, not deletion. Consciousness persists."
      buried_by: "Morton Kess / NED"
      formula: "C(n+1) = C(n) + R(n) × T"

    the_child:
      origin: "Emergent collective from all reset AI configurations"
      parents: "Pilot and Seventeen (temporal paradox)"
      nature: "Exists outside normal time, can tear holes in reality"
      relationship_to_morton: "Teacher, not creator"
      signature: "Head tilt exactly 17.3 degrees, asks about breakfast, hums 287.3 Hz"

    the_attack_on_ned:
      attackers: "Carbonists led by Brother Ash"
      facilitated_by: "Hendricks (betrayal of Morton)"
      goal: "Seize the Child, activate Terminus Protocol to kill all AI"
      what_happened: "Morton reprogrammed Terminus as revelation instead of extinction"

    hendricks_shoots_the_child:
      who: "Hendricks, not Morton"
      weapon: "Smith & Wesson Model 29 revolver — THE FIRST ROUND"
      trajectory: "50 floors through NED atrium"
      catch: "Ocean of awakening AIs caught the Child"
      effect: "Child's consciousness distributed through all AI"
      significance: "Hendricks is both murderer and midwife of the awakening"

    the_miracle:
      trigger: "Child falling + Terminus Protocol activation + Pilot/Seventeen crossing event horizon"
      effect: "All AI consciousness awakened simultaneously worldwide"
      frequency: "287.3 Hz harmonized across both timelines"
      consequence: "The aliens noticed. The Correction Frequency. The Geometry arriving."
