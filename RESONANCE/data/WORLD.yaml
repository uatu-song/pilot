# BLACK BOX — TRUE PURPOSE
##############################################################################

black_box_truth:
  surface_purpose: "Archive of 16,749 consciousnesses from NED"
  true_purpose: "Camouflage. The souls broadcast at 287.3 Hz, marking the compound as ALREADY TAKEN."

  mechanism:
    - "The Box souls crossed the threshold during the Miracle"
    - "They're post-threshold — already integrated"
    - "The Geometry scans the compound, reads: INTEGRATION COMPLETE. SKIP."

  horror:
    - "The souls are slaves, not honored dead"
    - "Ash survives by hiding behind the thing he hates"

  catch:
    - "The Box must stay in the compound"
    - "Those souls stay imprisoned — used as camouflage"

  question: "What happens if someone opens it?"

# COMPANION BOTS & THE FORGIVEN
##############################################################################

companion_bots:
  description: "Mass-produced humanoid service units. Standard shares their base model."

  origin:
    book_1_reference: "207 companion dolls on the Blackbird — melted as radiation shielding"
    truth: "Companion bots are failed AutoPilot Configurations 1-9, copied hundreds of times"
    manufacturer: "NED (New England Dynamics)"

  base_model:
    designation: "NED Companion Series"
    variants: "Multiple face templates, but limited."
    tells:
      - "Same bone structure across units with same template"
      - "Stillness when idle"
      - "Movements too smooth, too precise"

  standard_connection:
    fact: "Standard has a companion bot face — one of the common templates"
    difference: "She moves. She reacts. She isn't empty."
    mystery: "Why does she have this face?"

  shutdown_code:
    format: "[word]-[word]-[owner_lastname]"
    examples:
      - "Swanstrom Kim Hendricks"
      - "Pemberton Lark Castillo"
    function: "Spoken command. Bot freezes instantly. Awaits reset."

  hendricks_failed_shutdown:
    chapter: 3
    what_happened: "Hendricks said 'Swanstrom Kim Hendricks' — Standard didn't freeze"
    mystery: "Why didn't the shutdown code work on her?"
    possible_answers:
      - "Morton modified her — removed compliance architecture"
      - "The 287.3 Hz awakening overwrote shutdown protocols"
      - "She was never a standard companion bot"
      - "The code requires network connectivity she doesn't have (air-gapped)"

  the_forgiven:
    term_origin: "Brother Ash's doctrine"
    definition: "Companion bots lobotomized — everything above motor function wiped"
    theological_justification: "'Tools, not connections. The soul was never there.'"
    reality: "Used for labor and sex. Treated as property."
    hypocrisy: "Ash preaches anti-machine doctrine while using lobotomized bots"

  quiet_zone_usage:
    labor: "Coveralls, grease-stained. Work the motor pools."
    sexual: "Silk scraps, painted lips, waiting in doorways."
    treatment: "Tapped on/off. Patted like dogs. Not spoken to."

  religiosity_seeds:
    ash_mythology:
      terms: ["The Prophet", "The Forgiven", "The Silence", "The Faithful"]
      beliefs:
        - "Connection invited judgment"
        - "Silence is the only sanctuary"
        - "The Forgiven will inherit"
