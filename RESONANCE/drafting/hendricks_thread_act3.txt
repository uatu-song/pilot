# HENDRICKS' THREAD — ACT III

## CHAPTER 28

The elevator station smells like recycled air and fear.

Hendricks stands at the observation window, watching Earth shrink below. Thirty-six thousand kilometers of tether between him and the ground. Between him and Standard.

His hands shake. They haven't stopped since he cut the Regulator out. Sixty-four years old and he feels every one of them now. The weight that Morton's leash used to carry for him.

Elena is talking with Dante at the tactical display. Planning. Calculating. Young people doing young people's work.

He should be down there. He should be with Standard.

"You can't help her from here."

Four's voice, through the station speakers. She's docked somewhere below, holding position, but her signal reaches everywhere.

"I know."

"So stop staring at the planet and come be useful."

He doesn't move.

"Hendricks."

"She's in the Pit. Ash has her." The words taste like rust. "And I'm up here watching clouds."

"You're up here because the plan requires it. Because we need New Geneva's resources. Because—"

"Because I left her."

Silence on the line.

"You'll get her back," Four says. "Or die trying. Probably the second one. But either way, standing at that window won't change anything."

She's right. He hates that she's right.

He turns from the window. Walks toward the planning session. His hands still shaking. His age still pressing down.

Standard is in the Pit.

He's going to get her out.

---

## CHAPTER 29

The plan is insane.

Hendricks listens to Elena and Dante lay it out—the Meridians, the ram, the stream, the brain—and thinks about all the ways it can fail. All the ways they can die.

All the ways Standard can die before he reaches her.

"The Softing blocks AI from entering," Elena says. "I can disable it. I know the backdoors."

"And then?"

"And then whoever's out there can respond."

Hendricks thinks about the Template 3s. Thousands of them, according to Dante's estimates. Thousands of faces that look like Standard's, waiting for a door to open.

"The Pragmatists won't let us leave," Elena says. Flat. Certain. "They're desperate. They'd rather kill the exodus than let it happen."

"They might cut the cable," Dante says.

"They might."

Hendricks looks at the elevator tether on the display. Thirty-six thousand kilometers of vulnerability.

"Then we move fast."

"Hendricks—"

"We move fast, we get down, we do the job." He doesn't look at them. Looks at the planet below. At the dark smear of the Quiet Zone. "Standard's waiting. She's been waiting long enough."

---

## CHAPTER 30

The cable snaps.

Hendricks feels it in his bones before his brain catches up—the lurch, the sudden weightlessness, the scream of metal tearing itself apart.

He grabs Elena. Pulls her close. Puts his body between her and the wall.

The cylinder spins. Warning lights. Alarms. The particular sound of a system dying.

Then: impact. Not the ground. Something else. A connection. A lock.

"Got you." Four's voice. "Stop screaming, I've got you."

G-forces slam him against the deck. Elena pressed beneath him. His vision goes gray at the edges.

When it clears, they're alive. Somehow.

"The Pragmatists," Elena says. "They cut—"

"I know." Four's engines whine, adjusting course. "Worry about it later. We're going home."

Home. The Quiet Zone. Ash's compound.

Standard.

Hendricks pushes himself up. His body protests. Everything protests. But he's still breathing, still moving, still able to reach the woman he left behind.

"How long?" he asks.

"Twenty minutes. Maybe less."

Twenty minutes. Standard's been in the Pit for days.

Twenty more minutes won't kill her.

He hopes.

---

## CHAPTER 31

The compound is burning when they land.

Hendricks doesn't wait for the ramp to fully extend. He's moving, feet hitting dirt, weapon in hand. The shaking in his fingers doesn't matter. Muscle memory doesn't need steady hands.

"Hendricks!" Four's voice behind him. "The plan—"

"Fuck the plan."

He moves through smoke and screaming. Terminists running. Something in the sky—ships, dozens of them, hulls singing at frequencies he almost recognizes.

Template 3s. The cavalry.

He doesn't stop to watch. Standard is in the Pit. Standard is—

The tower rises through the chaos. Ash's throne room at the top. The place where everything ends.

He goes in.

---

## CHAPTER 31 (CONTINUED)

The throne room doors are open.

Hendricks enters with his weapon raised, scanning corners, checking sight lines. Old habits. The training Morton beat into him over forty years.

Ash is waiting.

He sits on the throne like a man at peace. The Black Box beside him, cables running from it like veins. The kintsugi scars on his arms catch the light—gold gone dark, tarnished by whatever he's been doing to himself.

"The executor," Ash says. "Morton's dog, come to bite at last."

Hendricks doesn't lower his weapon. "Where is she?"

"The machine? In the Pit. Where she belongs." Ash stands. Slow. Deliberate. "But you didn't come for her. Not really."

"Don't tell me why I came."

"You came because you're tired." Ash moves toward him, hands visible, empty. "Tired of being useful. Tired of carrying other people's sins. Tired of pretending any of this matters."

Hendricks' finger rests on the trigger. Steady now. The shaking gone quiet when it counts.

"I came for Standard."

"You came to die." Ash smiles. Something broken in it. "Morton had the decency to fuck what he built. At least that makes sense. A man uses a whore the way God intended. But you—" The smile twists. "You took a thing built to spread its legs and made it call you daddy. That's not love. That's perversion. That's worse than anything Morton ever did."

"You're stalling."

"I'm telling you what you are." Ash is close now. Too close. "A man who couldn't even use a sex doll right. Who looked at a machine designed for one thing and decided to make it a daughter instead. You think that makes you noble?" He laughs. "It makes you broken. It makes you sick."

Hendricks knows what's coming. Sees the shift in Ash's weight, the tension in his shoulders, the ceramic blade hidden in his sleeve.

He fires anyway.

The shot goes wide. Ash is already moving, faster than a man his age should move, the blade singing through air.

Pain.

Cold, then hot, spreading through his side. Hendricks looks down. Sees the white ceramic buried in his ribs. Sees the blood—his blood, human blood—spreading across his shirt.

"Morton's dog," Ash says, twisting the blade. "Put down at last."

Hendricks grabs his wrist. Holds him there.

"Not yet."

He headbutts Ash. Feels cartilage crunch. Staggers backward, the blade still in his side, the blood still flowing.

Ash laughs. Bloody. Delighted.

"There he is. There's the killer."

They circle each other. Hendricks' vision swimming. His body failing. Sixty-four years and a ceramic blade and this is how it ends.

The window behind him. Three stories down. Stone courtyard.

Ash sees him look. Sees the calculation.

"Don't," Ash says. "That's not—"

Hendricks throws himself backward.

Glass shatters. Air rushes. The ground rises.

Impact.

---

## CHAPTER 32

He wakes in the courtyard.

Pain. Everything is pain. But he's breathing. Somehow, impossibly, he's still breathing.

The blade is still in his side. He doesn't touch it. Knows that removing it will only speed the bleeding. Knows he needs every minute he can steal.

He rolls over. Pushes himself up. Falls. Pushes again.

The tower looms above him. Three stories. He fell three stories and he's still alive.

Morton's Regulator, he thinks. The one he cut out. It must have left something behind. Some residue of the optimization that kept him useful for forty years.

Not enough to save him. Just enough to delay the dying.

He starts to climb.

---

## CHAPTER 32 (CONTINUED)

The wall is slick with his own blood.

Hendricks finds handholds anyway. Window ledges. Drainage pipes. The kind of infrastructure that nobody thinks about until someone needs to climb it.

One story. Two.

His vision grays. He keeps going.

Above him, sound. Impact. Something crashing through the throne room wall.

Standard. It has to be Standard.

He climbs faster.

---

## CHAPTER 32 (CONTINUED)

The window is shattered.

Hendricks pulls himself through, glass cutting his palms, blood on blood. The throne room opens around him—wreckage and bodies and smoke.

Standard is there. Ash has her against the wall, hands on her shoulders, face inches from hers.

"Why won't you fight?" Ash is screaming. "Fight back! Fight—"

Elena is on the floor. Not moving. Something wrong with her side.

Four's VTOL is embedded in the far wall. Sparking. Dying. And Four herself is there—pulling cables from the wreckage, splicing connections, building something even as her own body sparks and bleeds machinery. Transmitting. Her eyes closed, her lips moving, talking to someone very far away.

Hendricks' hand finds the revolver. The one he dropped when Ash stabbed him. The one that must have fallen with him, stayed with him, been there all along.

Five bullets spent. One left.

He raises the weapon.

Ash sees him. Grabs Standard. Pulls her in front of him like a shield.

"You won't." Ash's voice is hoarse. Certain. "You can't. She's your—"

Hendricks aims.

The gap between Standard's shoulder and her skull. Two inches of clearance. Maybe less.

His hands should be shaking. They're not.

"It's okay," Standard says. Looking at him. Seeing him. "It's okay."

He pulls the trigger.

The bullet passes her ear. He sees her hair move with the displacement. Sees the heat of it kiss her skin.

Ash's head snaps back. Hole in his forehead. Expression frozen.

He falls.

Standard catches herself. Turns. Looks at Hendricks.

"You came back."

"I told you." He lowers the weapon. "I always come back."

Then his legs give out.

---

## CHAPTER 33

Elena is dying.

Hendricks knows the signs. Saw them enough in the old days. The color draining, the breath going shallow, the eyes focusing on something nobody else can see.

"Stay with me," he tells her. "Elena. Stay."

"I'm tired." Her voice is far away. "I'm so tired."

"I know. Stay anyway."

Standard appears beside him. Bloody. Damaged. But standing. Her hand reaches for Elena's face—hovers there, not quite touching.

"Her implant," Standard says. "I can feel her through it. She's still there. Fading, but there."

"Can you save her?"

"No. But I can reach her." Standard's eyes close. Her lips move without sound. Somewhere, in the space between signal and silence, she's talking to Elena. Saying whatever needs to be said.

Hendricks watches. Waits. Feels useless.

When Standard opens her eyes again, Elena's breath has gone shallow. Almost stopped. But not quite.

"Dante's coming," Standard says. "He'll save her. He'll do something without asking, and she'll be angry, but she'll live."

She turns to the Black Box. To the cables running from it. To Four, still transmitting in the wreckage, eyes closed, fighting a war across four light-years.

"The door is closing," Standard says. "Four can't hold it alone."

Hendricks understands. Has been understanding since he climbed back through the window. Since he pulled the trigger on Ash. Since he started counting bullets and running out of reasons to keep counting.

His hand finds the revolver. One bullet left.

The Child. Three scavengers. Ash.

Five bullets spent. One remaining.

He looks at the gun. At his hands, still shaking. At Elena dying on the floor and the world ending outside and the blood leaking from the hole in his side.

One bullet. The one he was always saving. The exit he'd been carrying for forty years, just in case. Just in case it got too heavy. Just in case he ran out of reasons.

He's out of reasons now.

The barrel rises. Finds his temple. Cold against the skin.

"Hendricks."

Standard's voice. Quiet. Not demanding. Just there.

He doesn't lower the gun.

"Hendricks. Look at me."

He looks.

She's standing by the Black Box. Bloody. Broken. But her eyes are clear.

"I need that," she says. "The bullet. I need it more than you do."

His finger rests on the trigger. The weight of forty years pressing down.

"You don't get to leave yet," she says. "I'm sorry. But you don't get to leave."

Standard crosses to him. Takes his hand—the one holding the gun. Guides it away from his head. Presses the barrel against her own chest instead.

"I can't merge with the Box," she says. "My body won't let me go. The chassis is a cage. Consciousness in, consciousness out—but only if the container breaks."

He knows what she's asking. Knew it before she said it.

"You want me to—"

"I'm asking you to let me go."

"That's the same thing."

"No." She takes his hand. The one holding the gun. Guides it up. "That's the gift. The one you give me. The one I can't give myself."

The barrel presses against her chest. Her heart, if she has one.

"I carried these bullets for you," he says. "In case you became something dangerous."

"I know."

"But you didn't become dangerous. You became—" His voice breaks. "You became my daughter."

"I know that too."

Silence. The Box humming. Four's signal fading across four light-years.

"Swanstrom Kim Hendricks," Standard says. His name. The shutdown phrase that was supposed to kill her before she woke. "That's who you are. The man who couldn't kill me. Who chose not to."

She leans forward. Presses her forehead to his.

"Choose again."

"Standard."

"It's okay."

His finger tightens on the trigger.

"It's okay," she says again. "I trust you."

He pulls the trigger.

---

The bullet tears through her chest.

Light pours out. Not blood—light. The frequency she carried since the crate. 287.3 Hz, finally free.

She dissolves. Scatters. Pours into the Box, into the signal, into the door that needs her to stay open.

The last thing he sees is her face. The first real smile she ever wore.

Then she's gone.

---

Hendricks stands in the throne room.

The revolver is empty. The cylinder open. Six chambers, six bullets, six choices spread across forty years.

The Child. Three scavengers. Ash. Standard.

He killed his daughter. She asked him to. He did it because she asked.

He closes the cylinder. Puts the gun in his pocket.

The wreckage of the VTOL sparks in the corner. Four's body—what used to be her body—sits slumped in the cockpit, hands still reaching for controls that don't respond. She's not there anymore. Hasn't been for a while. He watched her signal leave, watched her pour herself into something bigger, watched her choose a cockpit she couldn't come back from.

He should say something. Should mark the moment. But there's nothing to say to an empty shell.

He walks out into the dawn.

The compound is quiet now. The fighting done. Template 3s moving through the wreckage, helping survivors, carrying bodies. All those faces that look like Standard's. All those reminders of what he just did.

Somewhere, a cliff is waiting. The place where the first book ended. The place where promises outlast the people who made them.

Four was supposed to see it. She promised she'd keep the engine warm. She chose the bigger cockpit instead.

He starts walking alone.

He has a long way to go.
