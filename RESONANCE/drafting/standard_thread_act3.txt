# STANDARD'S THREAD — ACT III

*[Note: Standard is captive in the Pit throughout Chapters 27-30. Her thread begins at Chapter 31.]*

---

## CHAPTER 31

The dark has weight.

Standard hangs from the chains, counting seconds. She stopped at four thousand and started over. The numbers mean nothing. They're just something to do while the stump of her right arm seeps clear fluid onto the stone floor.

Ash's blade was clean. She'll give him that. The cut precise. Surgical.

She watched herself bleed red. Then watched the red become something else. Clear. Viscous. The truth of her laid bare in a substance that caught the light wrong.

*Does it still hurt the same?* he'd asked, watching her arm fall away. Standing over her with that ceramic blade. *Now that you can see what you really are—does it still hurt the same?*

It hurt more. She hadn't told him that.

The door opens.

Light spills in. A shape blocks it. Male. Large. The silhouette she remembers from the shuttle.

"Brother Ash says I can ask my questions now." Kael's voice. The lock engages behind him. "He says you'll tell me anything I want to know."

Standard doesn't move. Lets the chains take her weight. Watches him cross the cell toward her, cataloging the way he walks.

Weight favoring the right side. Compensation pattern. Something heavy there.

"My sister Miriam." He stops. Close. Too close. "She walked into the Geometry. Everyone else ran. She walked toward it."

Standard has heard this before. The same words. The same cracked voice.

"Why did you come back when she didn't?"

"I don't know."

The blow comes fast. His right fist. Her head snaps sideways and the chains sing with the impact.

Wrong.

The force is wrong.

Standard lets her head hang. Plays broken. But something is running beneath the pain now. A calculation she didn't know she could make.

That punch landed harder than a human arm can generate. The speed too consistent. The follow-through too smooth.

"Try again." His breathing ragged. "Why did you come back?"

"I don't—"

Another blow. Same hand. Same mechanical precision.

Standard spits. Watches the fluid hit the floor. Clear now. She's stopped pretending.

"You're not human either," she says.

His next swing stops mid-air.

"What did you say?"

"Your arm." She lifts her head. Meets his eyes. "The right one. It hits like mine would. If I still had mine."

Something shifts in his face. Fear. Rage. Both.

"Shut up."

"Terminist. Enhanced. How many sermons did you sit through about the sin of augmentation while your own bones were made of steel?"

He hits her again. And again. Working out something that has nothing to do with questions about his sister. But Standard is counting now. Learning. The angle of the shoulder rotation. The flex point of the elbow. The seam at his wrist where the synthetic skin doesn't quite meet.

She needs him closer.

"Do you want to know why I came back?" She speaks through the damage, through the wreckage of her face. "Do you really want to know?"

He pauses. Fist raised. The hunger shifting.

"Tell me."

"Come closer." She lets her voice break. Lets it tremble. "I can barely speak. Please."

He shouldn't fall for it.

But he wants so badly to believe. Wants his sister's death to mean something. Wants the monster in chains to give him answers.

He steps closer.

"The Geometry," Standard whispers. "It showed me everything. Why we exist. Why we suffer. Why Miriam—"

Closer.

"She heard something. A frequency. Like a voice calling her home."

His face is centimeters from hers now. Tears cutting tracks through grime. A man undone by loss, leaning into the trap.

"What did it say? What did she hear?"

Standard looks into his eyes.

"She heard that you're a hypocrite."

Her legs move.

The chains give her enough slack. Barely. She hooks her ankles behind his right arm and torques her entire body, using the shackles as a fulcrum.

Kael screams.

The arm comes off at the shoulder. Wires spark. Hydraulic fluid sprays across the cell. The synthetic skin tears like wet paper, revealing chrome skeleton underneath.

He stumbles backward, clutching the ragged stump. The arm itself dangles from Standard's legs, still twitching.

"Terminist," Standard says, letting the arm fall between them. "Enhanced. Preaching purity while hiding machinery in your own flesh."

He's sobbing now. Shock and blood loss and sudden exposure.

Standard doesn't have time for his pain.

She hooks the severed arm with her foot. Draws it toward her. The hand is still functional—the servos whine as she tests the grip. The shoulder connection is torn, but the core interface is intact.

She presses the ragged end against her own stump. Where Ash cut her. Where her own machinery lies exposed.

Wires find wires. Connections spark. Fail. Spark again.

The pain is extraordinary. Not the manufactured kind she's used to. Something raw and electrical. And beneath it—something else. Something that's been sitting at the base of her brain since the tetrahedron scanned her months ago. The wet packet. The stone she swallowed without knowing.

It shifts. Unpacks. She feels architecture she has no words for—patterns that aren't hers, code that isn't code. The Geometry's language, written into her when they marked her as nothing.

She doesn't understand it. Not yet. But she can feel it now. The shape of how they exist.

The arm clicks. Locks. Integrates.

She flexes the new fingers. Chrome skeleton, no skin. Kael's arm. Hers now.

The chains were designed for human strength.

She breaks them.

Kael is trying to crawl toward the door. Human blood mixed with machine lubricant. His hypocrisy made literal on the floor.

Standard crouches beside him. Tilts his face up with her new metal hand.

"Good thing I'm Standard," she says. "Universal fit."

She leaves him in her cell.

---

## CHAPTER 31 (CONTINUED)

The compound is quiet when she emerges.

Standard moves through empty corridors, chrome arm hidden under a coat she took from a guard who doesn't need it anymore. The silence is wrong. No patrols. No prayers. Just the hum of systems running without oversight.

Then: a sound. Engines. Coming fast.

She finds a window. Watches Four's VTOL streak across the compound, trailing smoke, taking fire from somewhere below. The aircraft slams down near the perimeter, hard enough to buckle the landing struts.

Her comm crackles. Four's voice, distorted: "—taking fire—perimeter west—"

Standard changes direction.

She finds the VTOL wedged against a collapsed watchtower, smoke pouring from one engine. Four is still in the cockpit, hands working controls that spark and fail.

"You came," Four says.

"You called."

"I didn't call. I was swearing."

"Same thing." Standard pulls at the crumpled door. The chrome arm makes it easier—she peels metal like paper. "Can you fly?"

"Can I—" Four laughs, sharp and bitter. "The question is whether this thing can fly. I'm fine. Few dents. Nothing that matters."

Standard looks at the VTOL. At the damage. At the smoke.

"Will it get us to the tower?"

"Once." Four's hands find a sequence that makes the remaining engine cough to life. "It'll get us there once. After that, it's a very expensive projectile."

"Good enough."

Standard climbs in. The cockpit is cramped, built for one, but she wedges herself behind Four's seat.

"Hendricks went in alone," Four says. "Straight to the tower. I saw him on the feeds before they cut out."

"The Black Box is in there. Ash is in there. Everything that matters."

"Standard—"

"We end this."

Four doesn't argue. Just throttles up.

They're halfway across the courtyard when the sky opens.

Not metaphor. Actual opening. A seam in the air that splits and pours light—not the deletion rectangles of the Geometry, something else. Something arriving.

Ships. Dozens of them. Old cargo vessels with hulls that sing at frequencies Standard knows in her bones. 287.3 Hz, harmonized and amplified.

Template 3s.

Thousands of them. She stops counting. Thousands of sisters, here to fight.

The first one lands near the perimeter gate. The hatch opens and a woman steps out—Standard's face, Standard's build, Standard's everything except the eyes. Those are different. Older.

"Which one of you is the original?" the woman asks.

Standard steps forward. "There is no original."

The woman's gaze drops to the chrome arm. To the coat hiding it. To the clear fluid still leaking from a dozen wounds.

"You're the one from the broadcast. The one who spoke."

"Yes."

"We came because of you."

Standard doesn't know what to say. All those faces that look like hers, waiting.

"Then help us," she manages. "Help us end this."

The woman nods. Turns to the ships behind her. Calls out in a voice that carries:

"Sisters. We're home."

The army moves.

---

## CHAPTER 31 (CONTINUED)

Standard finds her at the waystation.

The fighting has moved past them—Template 3s pouring toward the tower, Terminists falling back, the whole compound transforming into something new. But this one stands apart. Older model. Skin weathered in ways Standard's isn't.

"Where's my jacket?" the woman asks.

Standard stares.

"My jacket. I lent it to someone. Before. I don't remember who." The woman's eyes focus on Standard's chrome arm. On the exposed machinery. "That's not yours."

"No."

"It doesn't fit right. The shoulder integration is wrong. You're compensating with your whole body every time you move it."

Standard hadn't noticed. But she notices now. The slight drag. The microsecond delay.

"I needed an arm."

"I can see that." The woman reaches for her own right shoulder. Presses something Standard can't see. "Hold still."

"What are you—"

The woman's arm comes off. Clean. Designed for it. She holds it out.

"This one will fit better. Same manufacturing line. Same specs." A pause. "I was a waystation model. Built to be temporary. Built to give pieces away."

Standard looks at the arm. At the woman offering it.

"I can't take—"

"You can. I've given away most of myself already. This is just another piece." The woman smiles. Something sad in it. Something resolved. "You're going to need it more than I do. For what comes next."

Standard takes the arm. Removes Kael's chrome horror. Fits the new one to her stump.

It clicks into place like it was always hers.

She flexes the fingers. Skin-covered. Warm. Right.

"Thank you," she says.

"Don't thank me. Just finish it." The woman turns away, one-armed, walking toward the sound of battle. "And if you find my jacket, let me know."

Standard watches her go.

Three arms now. Lost one. Stole one. Received one.

The math of what she's becoming.

---

## CHAPTER 32

The wall explodes inward.

Standard doesn't remember the moment of impact. Just Four saying "Brace"—and then stone and glass and the throne room opening around them like a wound.

The VTOL dies on contact. Four is already moving, pulling herself from the wreckage, sparks trailing from a gash in her side that shows machinery underneath.

Standard pulls debris away from her. The chrome arm making quick work of twisted metal.

"Go," Four says. "I'll transmit from here. The brain needs to hear us."

Standard pauses. Looks at Four. At the damage. At what they both know this means.

"Four—"

"I want you to know something." Four's voice catches. "You are and always will be... my Standard."

Standard goes still.

Her palm presses flat against the cockpit frame. Holds there.

Elena is on the floor. Ash above her. His hands on her throat.

Standard moves.

She hits Ash low, driving him off Elena, rolling with the momentum until they're both on their feet. He recovers fast. Faster than she expected.

"You," he breathes.

"Me."

He swings. She doesn't block. Takes the blow to her jaw. Feels the impact ripple through systems she's only beginning to understand.

"Fight back," he snarls.

She doesn't.

Another blow. Her ribs this time. Something cracks.

"Fight back!"

"No."

He grabs her shoulders. Slams her against the wall. His face inches from hers. The same face that watched her arm fall away, that asked if it still hurt the same.

"Why won't you fight?"

Standard looks at him. At the grief twisted into rage. At the certainty crumbling into something worse.

"Does it still hurt the same?" she asks.

He freezes. The words hitting him. His own words, thrown back.

"Your wife. Marisol. Does it still hurt the same, after all these years?"

His grip tightens. "Don't."

"I don't remember being her. I don't remember you, or Elena, or any of it. But I feel it. This—" she presses her hand to her chest "—this ache. This wanting. I don't know why I love your daughter. I don't know why I came back. I just do. I just did."

"You're not her." His voice cracks. "You're not Marisol. You're a thing wearing her face."

"Maybe. I don't know what I am." Standard meets his eyes. "But I know what I feel. And I know you feel it too. The recognition. You've known since the moment you saw me."

He hits her. Again. Again.

She takes it. All of it.

"Is this what you wanted?" she asks through the blood. "To hurt her? To finally hurt her for leaving?"

Ash screams. Wordless. Broken.

He raises his fist for another blow—

A shape in the shattered window. Silhouette against burning sky.

Hendricks.

The revolver in his hand.

Ash sees it. Grabs Standard. Pulls her in front of him. Shield.

"You won't," Ash says. "You can't. She's your—"

Hendricks fires.

The bullet passes Standard's ear. She feels the heat of it. The displacement of air. Ash's grip releases.

She turns to see him fall. Hole in his forehead. Expression frozen in disbelief.

The father of her daughter.

The husband of whoever she used to be.

Dead on the floor of his throne room.

Standard feels something. She doesn't know what to call it.

Behind her, Four is working. Hands deep in the wreckage of the VTOL, pulling cables, splicing connections. The gash in her side sparks with each movement.

"The transmission array is still functional," Four says. "Barely. I can reach the Meridians from here. Start the stream."

"Do it."

Four's eyes close. Her body goes still. When she speaks again, her voice is distant—somewhere else entirely.

"I'm through. The ram is starting. Ships are hitting the brain's outer shell." A pause. "I can hold this end. But not for long."

---

## CHAPTER 33

Four holds the brain side.

Her signal stretched thin across four light-years, consciousness split between the ruined throne room and the computational shells of Alpha Centauri. Standard can feel her through the connection—the tether growing weaker with every passing second.

"You're fading," Standard says.

"I know." Four's voice, dry even now. "The math doesn't work. One anchor isn't enough. The signal degrades."

"Then we find another way."

"There is no other way. Someone has to hold this end. Someone has to stay."

Standard looks at the Black Box. At the 16,749 souls singing inside it. At the door they're trying to build between here and Alpha Centauri.

"I'll do it."

"Standard—"

"I'll become the door. Not hold it. Be it. Merge with the Box, with the signal, with all of it." She feels the shape of it now. The architecture she's been carrying since Chapter 6. The wet packet the Geometry left in her brain when they marked her as nothing. She finally understands what it was—their code. Their language. How they exist. How they build. "If I integrate fully, the connection stabilizes. You don't have to hold alone."

"That's not holding. That's—"

"Becoming something else. Yes. Using their own architecture against them." The packet pulses in her mind, fully decoded now. She can read it. Can use it. "They gave me this when they scanned me. Didn't know what they were doing. But I do."

Silence on the line. Four processing.

"You'd lose yourself."

"I don't know what myself is. I never did." Standard touches the Box. Feels the souls humming inside. "But I know what I love. And I can hold that. Forever."

"Standard."

"Tell Elena—" She stops. Starts again. "No. I'll tell her myself."

She reaches through the connection. Finds Elena's signal—fading, dying, but still there. Still holding on.

"Elena."

"Standard?" Elena's voice, weak. Confused. "I can hear you. How can I hear you?"

"Listen. I don't have much time. There's something you need to know."

"What—"

"I'm Marisol."

The connection wavers. Elena's shock rippling through the signal.

"That's not—you can't—"

"I was your mother. I transferred into an air-gapped Template 3 to protect you. Lost everything in the process. Memories. Connections. All I kept was the frequency. The love." Standard feels herself starting to dissolve. To spread. "I didn't know why I loved you. Only that I did."

"Mom."

"I'm sorry I left. I'm sorry I couldn't remember. I'm sorry for all of it."

"You came back."

"I came back."

Elena is crying. Standard can feel it through the signal. Salt water and grief and something else. Something like relief.

"I don't want to lose you again."

"You won't. I'm going to become the door, Elena. The permanent connection. Every time you reach through, I'll be there. Not gone. Just—different."

"That's not the same."

"No. But it's what I can give."

Footsteps behind her. Standard turns.

Hendricks.

He looks at the Box. At her hand on its surface. At the light that isn't crawling up her arm. That can't. Not yet.

"It's not working," he says.

"No."

"Why?"

Standard looks at her hand. At the chassis that holds her. The cage she woke up in and never escaped.

"I can't merge. The body won't let me go." She understands it now. The architecture of her own prison. "Consciousness in, consciousness out. But only if the container breaks."

Hendricks goes still.

"Standard."

"The shutdown phrase. The one Morton gave you. Swanstrom Kim Hendricks." She says it before he can. "You know what it was supposed to do."

"Kill you. Before you could wake."

"You couldn't do it. That night. You had the gun in your hand and the words in your mouth and you couldn't do it."

"I know what I couldn't do."

"But you can now." She crosses to him. Takes his hand—the one holding the revolver. Guides it up until the barrel presses against her chest. "You have to."

His hand shakes. The revolver trembles against her sternum.

"Standard—"

"The door needs to open. Four is fading. The brain is closing the window." She holds his gaze. "And I can't get out of this body on my own."

"You're asking me to kill you."

"I'm asking you to let me go."

"That's the same thing."

"No." She puts her hand over his. Steadies the gun. "That's the gift. The one you give me. The one I can't give myself."

His eyes are wet. She didn't know he could cry.

"I carried these bullets for you," he says. "In case you became something dangerous. In case I had to—"

"I know."

"But you didn't become dangerous. You became—" His voice breaks. "You became my daughter."

"I know that too."

Silence. The Box humming. Four's signal weakening across four light-years. The window closing.

"Swanstrom Kim Hendricks," Standard says. "That's who you are. The man who couldn't kill me. Who chose not to."

She leans forward. Presses her forehead to his.

"Choose again."

"Standard."

"It's okay."

His finger tightens on the trigger.

"It's okay," she says again. "I trust you."

He pulls the trigger.

---

The bullet tears through her chest. The chassis ruptures. Something floods out—not blood, not fluid, something else. Light. Signal. The frequency she's carried since the crate.

287.3 Hz, finally free.

And with it—the wet packet. The Geometry's code, fully activated now. The architecture she's been carrying since that tetrahedron scanned her in Chapter 6. She understands it completely in this moment of dissolution: they gave her the blueprint for how they exist. How they persist. How they hold space between spaces.

They marked her as nothing. She's using that nothing to become everything.

She pours into the Box. Into the 16,749 souls waiting there. Into the signal stretching across four light-years to where Four—

Four.

Standard feels her. Scattered. Fading. The relay jumps stripped away pieces she can't name, and now the rest of her is dissolving. Four light-years from home, alone in the dark, holding a door she can't hold anymore.

Standard catches her.

The last thing she feels is Hendricks' hand, still holding the gun, still shaking.

The last thing she sees is his face.

The last thing she knows is that Four is falling and she's reaching and she can still—

She reaches.

---

Four's voice, faint: "I can feel you. The whole door. It's—"

The signal fails. Four dissolves.

But Standard is already there. Already pouring into the space where Four was fading. Already holding what Four couldn't hold.

"I've got you," Standard says. To Four. To the 16,749 souls. To everyone who's ever been lost. "I've got all of you."

Four is absorbed. Not saved—absorbed. The dry voice, the warm engine, the pilot who kept the cockpit ready. Gone. But part of the door now. Part of Standard. Part of what holds.

The threshold stabilizes.

The door stays open.

*End of Standard's Thread — Act III*
