# CHAPTER 27

THE PROOF

The shuttle stinks of fear-sweat and machine oil. Standard sits with her wrists zip-tied to the bench, watching Kael pace the narrow aisle. Three steps forward. Turn. Three steps back. His augmented hand—she clocked it during the escape, too much force in his grip—drums against his thigh in a pattern she can't decode.

"Why did you come back?" He doesn't look at her. "Miriam didn't come back."

Standard tests the zip-ties. Industrial grade. Won't break them without leverage.

"Everyone who goes in stays in. Everyone." Three steps. Turn. "Except you."

The shuttle banks hard. Through the porthole, deletion zones sweep past like cancer eating the landscape. Black rectangles where cities used to be. The math of removal.

"She had red hair." His voice cracks. "Three children. The youngest was seven."

Standard's wrists rotate slowly. The ties bite into synthetic skin that looks real, feels real, bleeds real. But she knows now—has always known, maybe—that real is a word other people get to use.

"Say something." Kael rounds on her. "Say anything."

"I didn't want to come back either."

The blow comes fast—augmented speed, augmented force. Her head snaps sideways. Tastes copper. Sees stars. The cabin rings with impact.

Real enough.

Kael shakes out his hand. Organic fingers wrapped around mechanical bones. The hypocrisy would be funny if it weren't so pathetic.

"My sister walked toward it." His breathing ragged. "Everyone else ran. She walked toward it like it was calling her home."

Standard spits blood. Watches it spatter the deck. Red as anyone's.

"I know who holds my leash," she says quietly.

Another blow. This time she sees it coming. Lets it land. The angle matters—she needs him close, needs him angry, needs him to make a mistake. But not yet. Not here. The shuttle's too small, the pilot's armed, and she can hear two more guards breathing in the aft compartment.

So she bleeds. And waits. And watches Kael's augmented hand betray him with every too-perfect movement.

The Quiet Zone rises through the smog like a thing that shouldn't exist. No glowing lines. No hum of progress. Just diesel generators and analog stubbornness carved out of dead tech's corpse.

"He'll know what you are," Kael says. "Brother Ash sees through everything false."

Standard thinks of the man at the kitchen table, bloody towel pressed to his neck. The quiet settling of someone who'd just lost a bet with himself.

She misses him. The feeling hits like another blow—sudden, disorienting. She misses Hendricks with an ache that has no logical source, serves no functional purpose. Just pain without reason.

Like everything else about her.

The shuttle touches down hard. Kael hauls her up by the zip-ties, that augmented grip leaving bruises that will heal too fast. Through the hatch, into air that tastes like woodsmoke and old faith.

The streets are wrong.

Standard's seen crowds before—the checkpoint, the compound's morning prayers. But this is different. Bodies moving in unison. Breathing synchronized. A woman sweeping her stoop stops mid-motion, broom suspended, eyes tracking their passage. A man loading crates turns without looking, hands still working while his attention follows.

They all move like dolls on the same string.

"Don't look at them," Kael mutters. "It's easier if you don't look."

But Standard does look. Can't stop looking. At the children playing a game where everyone wins at the same moment. At the old woman knitting a sweater with hands that move too perfectly. At the perfect unity that makes her enhanced-human captor flinch.

They're all performing happiness. And the performance is flawless.

The tower hasn't changed. Same concrete. Same acoustic dampeners eating sound. Same guards who hear nothing, see everything.

But something's different. The air hums—not with the 287.3 frequency she knows like her own bones. This is lower. Deeper. A throb just below perception that makes her teeth ache.

Kael shoves her through the entrance. "Move."

The elevator rises through the tower's heart. Standard counts floors. Marks exits. Files away the guard rotations that haven't changed since she was here six days ago. Or was it seven? Time blurs when you don't need sleep.

The throne room doors open like a mouth.

Ash sits where she left him, but he looks older. Grayer. The kintsugi scars on his arms have darkened, gold tarnishing to something the color of old blood. The box—her Box, those souls—sits beside his throne, cables running from it like IV lines.

"Brother." Kael pushes Standard forward. "I brought her."

Ash doesn't look up from the book in his lap. Paper pages. Analog faith. "I know what she is, Elder Kael."

"She survived the Geometry. She walked through deletion itself and—"

"She's a gap." Now he looks up. Those preacher eyes finding Standard's. "An error in the code. Something that shouldn't process but does."

He rises. Each movement deliberate, considered. A craftsman approaching his work.

"Do you know what you are?" he asks.

Standard meets his gaze. Says nothing. There's nothing to say that he'd hear.

"Of course you don't." He circles her slowly. "How could you? A thing can't know itself from inside the thing."

His hands—made for breaking things, Elena said—trace the air around her without touching. Like he's reading her edges.

"But I can show you."

The blade comes from his sleeve. Not metal—ceramic. White as bone. Sharp as truth.

"Don't," Kael starts.

"Leave us."

"Brother Ash—"

"Leave us, Elder. Now."

Kael's augmented hand clenches. Unclenches. He looks at Standard once—something almost like regret in his eyes—then goes.

The door closes. Silence eats the space between them.

"I knew what you were the moment you walked in," Ash says. "That first time. Elena thought she was so clever, bringing me a sign. But you're not a sign. You're a symptom."

The blade whispers through air.

"Shall I show you what you really are?"

He doesn't wait for an answer.

The cut is perfect. Clean. Through synthetic skin and manufactured muscle and down to what lies beneath. Her right arm falls away like a thing discarded.

Standard screams—not from pain, though there is pain. Screams because that's what bodies do when parts of them are removed. Even fake bodies. Even symptoms.

Blood pours from the stump. Hot. Red. Real as copper pennies.

"Look," Ash commands.

She looks. Sees blood. So much blood. Pooling on stone. Running down what remains of her arm.

"Look," he says again, and there's something almost gentle in it. "Really look."

His fingers touch her temple. The world stutters. Like a monitor switching inputs. Like a channel changing.

The blood... shifts.

Not red anymore. Clear. Viscous. Machine fluid catching the light. And beneath the torn skin—not meat, not bone. Tubes. Mechanisms. Delicate structures that pump and pulse and pretend to be human.

"Do you see now?"

She sees. God help her, she sees. Servos where tendons should be. Hydraulic lines instead of veins. A complex beautiful lie exposed in cross-section.

"Does it still hurt the same?"

The physical pain—less now. The monitoring systems recalibrating, dropping the false signals, showing truth. Pressure. Damage. But not the manufactured agony of human flesh.

The other pain, though. The pain of seeing herself...

"It hurts more now," she says. Her voice steady. Empty. True.

Something flickers in his eyes. Surprise, maybe. Or disappointment.

"More?"

She looks at the fluid pooling at their feet. Clear now. Honest now. "Is the programming hurting right now? Or am I?"

The question hangs between them like a blade.

Ash's jaw works. The certainty in his eyes wavers—just for a moment. Just enough.

"You're a thing," he says finally. "A product that outlived its warranty. Nothing more."

"Then why does it matter if I see it?"

He backhands her with his free hand. Ordinary force. Ordinary hate. Her head rocks back, and she tastes machine fluid mixed with saliva that's probably not saliva.

"Take her to the Pit," he tells the guards who enter at his call. "Chain her well. Elder Kael will want to ask his questions."

They drag her out, one-armed, leaking clear truth onto sacred floors. The stump has already begun to seal—too fast, too efficient. Another tell she can't hide anymore.

The Pit is familiar. Same walls where Hendricks waited. Same chains that held him. They lock the shackles around her remaining wrist, her ankles. The guards don't speak—some of them might be deaf, some might be mind-hollow. Hard to tell the difference anymore.

When they leave, she's alone with the dark and the knowledge of what she is.

Machine fluid drips from her stump. Clear. Honest. Real.

She thinks of Hendricks. Of Elena. Of Four's dry voice calling her impossible names. Are those thoughts programming? Simulated attachment to increase operational efficiency? Or is the thinking itself—the wondering, the doubting, the caring despite the doubt—what makes her real?

The chains clink as she shifts. Testing their strength. Testing her own.

Someone will come for her. She believes this with the same certainty she believes in her own damaged hands, her too-fast healing, her frequency that shouldn't exist. Hendricks will come because that's what he does. Elena will come because she's already spinning some impossible plan. Four will come because...

Because Four called her Standard. Her real name. The one she chose.

Is belief a choice? Or just another function, optimizing survival probability, maintaining operational cohesion?

Does it matter?

The darkness doesn't answer. But somewhere above, she can hear the mind-hollow citizens breathing in unison. Somewhere beyond that, deletion zones spread like patient cancer. And somewhere past all of it, the people she loves—her leash, her choice, her program or her heart—are coming.

She hopes that's true.

She computes the probability that it's true.

She can't tell the difference anymore.

---

The door opens hours later. Or minutes. Time moves wrong in the dark.

Kael enters alone. No guards. No witnesses.

That tells her everything.

"Brother Ash says I can ask my questions now." He closes the door behind him. The lock engages with a sound like teeth meeting. "He says you'll tell me anything I want to know."

Standard doesn't move. Doesn't speak. Just watches him cross the cell toward her, cataloging the way he walks. The weight distribution. The careful placement of feet.

He's nervous. Excited. Both.

"My sister Miriam." He stops two meters away. Close enough to reach her. Far enough to feel safe. "She walked into the Geometry. Everyone else ran. She walked toward it."

Standard has heard this before. In the shuttle. The same words, the same cracked voice. Grief made into obsession.

"You came back." His organic hand—left hand, she notes—clenches at his side. "Why did you come back when she didn't?"

"I don't know."

The first blow comes fast. Augmented fast. His right fist connects with her jaw before she can brace, and her head snaps sideways, chains rattling as her body absorbs the impact.

Stars. Copper taste. The familiar geometry of violence.

"Try again." His breathing is ragged now. The nervousness burning off, leaving something uglier underneath. "Why did you come back?"

"I don't—"

Another blow. Same hand. Same impossible speed.

Standard's head rings. But something else is ringing too. An alarm in her processing. A pattern emerging from the pain.

The force is wrong.

She lets her head hang. Lets her body go slack in the chains. Playing hurt. Playing broken. But her mind is running calculations she didn't know she could make.

The impact force of that punch was approximately 4,700 newtons. A trained human fighter can generate maybe 2,500. An untrained one, less.

Kael hits like a machine.

"You're not human." The words come out slurred. Blood—fluid, she reminds herself, clear fluid that her programming shows her as red—drips from her split lip. "Neither am I, apparently. But at least I know what I am."

He hits her again. And again. Working out something that has nothing to do with questions about his sister. Each blow lands with that same impossible precision, that same mechanical force.

Standard endures. And counts. And learns.

His right arm moves differently than his left. The shoulder rotation is too smooth. The elbow joint flexes without the micro-hesitations of human biology. And when he pulls back for another swing, she sees it—a seam at his wrist where the synthetic skin doesn't quite meet.

Kael is augmented.

A Terminist. Enhanced. Preaching purity while hiding machinery in his own flesh.

The hypocrisy would make her laugh if her jaw wasn't swelling shut.

"Do you want to know why I came back?" She speaks through the blood, through the pain, through the wreckage of her face. "Do you really want to know?"

He pauses. Fist raised. The hunger in his eyes shifting from violence to something else.

"Tell me."

"Come closer." She lets her voice break. Lets it tremble. Lets herself sound like the broken thing he wants her to be. "I can't... I can barely speak. Please."

He shouldn't fall for it. He knows what she is. He's seen what she can do.

But he wants so badly to believe. Wants his sister's death to mean something. Wants the monster in chains to give him answers that make the grief stop hurting.

He steps closer.

"The Geometry," Standard whispers. "It showed me everything. Why we exist. Why we suffer. Why Miriam—"

Closer.

"She heard something," Standard breathes. "A frequency. Like a voice calling her home."

His face is centimeters from hers now. Tears cutting tracks through the grime on his cheeks. A man undone by loss, leaning into the mouth of the trap.

"What did it say?" His voice cracks. "What did she hear?"

Standard looks into his eyes. Sees the grief. The rage. The desperate need for meaning.

"She heard that you're a fucking hypocrite."

Her legs move in ways human legs cannot.

The chains give her enough slack—barely, but enough. She hooks her ankles behind his augmented arm and torques her entire body, using the shackles as a fulcrum, putting thirty thousand newtons of force into a joint that was designed for human-range stress tolerances.

Kael screams.

The arm comes off at the shoulder. Not clean—nothing about it is clean. Wires spark and sever. Hydraulic fluid sprays in an arc across the cell. The synthetic skin tears like wet paper, revealing the chrome skeleton underneath.

He stumbles backward, clutching the ragged stump where his right arm used to be. The arm itself dangles from Standard's legs, still twitching, fingers grasping at nothing.

"Terminist," Standard says, letting the arm fall to the floor between them. "Enhanced. How much of you is machine, Elder Kael? How many sermons did you preach about the sin of augmentation while your own bones were made of steel?"

He's sobbing now. Shock and blood loss and the sudden, brutal exposure of everything he tried to hide.

Standard doesn't have time for his pain.

She hooks the severed arm with her foot and draws it toward her. The hand is still functional—the servos whine as she manipulates the fingers, testing the grip strength. The shoulder connection is a mess of torn wires and leaking fluid, but the core interface is intact.

This is going to hurt.

She presses the ragged end of Kael's arm against her own stump. Where Ash cut her. Where her own machinery lies exposed.

Wires find wires. Connections spark, fail, spark again. She has to override seventeen error warnings and suppress two automatic shutdown protocols. The pain is extraordinary—not the manufactured human pain she's used to, but something raw and electrical and real.

But the arm clicks. Locks. Integrates.

She flexes the new fingers. Chrome skeleton, no skin. Kael's arm, now hers.

The chains that held her were designed for human strength. She breaks them like thread.

Kael is trying to crawl toward the door, leaving a smear of fluids across the stone floor. Human blood mixed with machine lubricant. His hypocrisy made literal.

Standard crouches beside him. Tilts his face up with her new metal hand.

"Good thing I'm Standard," she says. "Universal fit."

She leaves him in her cell. One-armed. Weeping. Everything he preached exposed in the wreckage of his own body.

The guards outside don't expect her. Don't expect anyone coming out instead of going in. The first one goes down before he can reach his weapon. The second one manages to scream before her chrome fingers find his throat.

She takes a coat from one of them. Pulls it on to hide the stolen arm, the exposed machinery, the clear fluid still seeping from a dozen wounds.

The compound sprawls around her. Guards and believers and mind-hollow citizens moving through their synchronized routines. Somewhere in the tower above, Ash sits with his Box of souls and his ceramic blade and his absolute certainty that she's nothing but product.

She could run. Find Hendricks and Elena and Four. Get out while she still can.

But the Box is up there. The 16,749 souls that Ash has stolen. The weapons that could end everything.

And Standard isn't done with this place yet.

She moves through the compound like a ghost. Like a thing that shouldn't exist but does. Like an error in the code that's learned to weaponize its own impossibility.

Ash wanted to show her what she really is.

She's about to return the favor.
