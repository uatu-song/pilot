# CHARACTER STATE: ELENA

**As Of:** Chapter 17 (End) — POST-TRANSCRIPT
**Last Updated:** December 25, 2025

---

## LOCATION

**Current:** Four (VTOL), cargo bay
**With:** Standard, Hendricks (unconscious), Four (AI)
**Heading:** Geneva (clear of Geometry and Sovereignty)

---

## TRANSCRIPT STATUS

Elena was dissolved to "probability foam" during the Geometry transit and reconstituted by Four. She has no memory of this. The Geometry called her and Hendricks "flesh" — "they were never very specific to begin with."

Four pulled her back first (Transcript 00:31:00-42). She was restored to baseline — no pattern variant selected.

## KNOWLEDGE STATE

### Knows Now:
- The Black Box powers the Quiet Zone (she delivered it)
- She killed 16,749 consciousnesses (Goff, Otis, Aikin died for it)
- **Hendricks shot the Child** — the knowledge bomb has DETONATED (Ch 9)
- Her father sent Hendricks to be executed without telling her
- Standard is "unclassified" — not human, not machine, something else
- Standard can fly a VTOL
- Standard was immune to the Correction Frequency
- Standard has 40,000 doppelgangers (Template 3)
- People worship Standard
- Four is a sentient VTOL AI
- They transited the Geometry (42 minutes missing)
- Her mother Marisol left when she was 7 for "the signal"

### Learned Since Ch 4:
- Abbey Otis's mother was at the outpost; left her water vouchers (Ch 7)
- Hendricks worked for Morton-Kess (Ch 8)
- Hendricks had one unaccounted bullet — she now knows it killed the Child
- Her father recognized Hendricks as "Morton's dog" (Ch 9)
- Standard quotes her mother's words: "She has your face. But not your frequency." (Ch 11)
- Standard heard something in isolation — "a name" (Ch 12)

### Still Doesn't Know:
- What Standard truly is
- What happened during the 42 minutes in the Geometry
- Whether her mother is alive
