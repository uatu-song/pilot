## KNOWLEDGE STATE

### Knows Now:
- Her name is "Standard" (self-chosen from insult, Ch 5)
- Hendricks' first name is "Sabino" (Ch 7)
- "Swanstrom Kim Hendricks" was a shutdown code attempt, not his name (Ch 7)
- She is Template 3 — one of 40,000 units (Ch 16)
- She has a doppelganger at the waystation (Ch 16)
- The doppelganger was conscious before the Miracle (Ch 16)
- She can fly a VTOL (learned instinctively, Ch 15)
- Four is a sentient VTOL AI who names her things (Ch 15-17)
- The Geometry scanned her and dismissed her (Ch 6)
- People worship her — they kneel when they see her (Ch 16)
- Someone tried a shutdown code on her at the waystation — it didn't work (Ch 16)
- She heard "a name" in isolation — a vision of a woman saying "Mija" (Ch 12)
- She quoted Marisol's words without knowing whose they were (Ch 11)
- Ash is afraid of her (Ch 11)
- They transited the Geometry — 42 minutes missing (Ch 17)
- The Sovereignty scanned her as "unclassified" (Ch 17)

### Still Doesn't Know:
- She is an android
- Morton created her
- She carries the Source Code for Mortality
- Why she's immune to the signal
- Whose memory/words she accessed (Marisol's)
- What happened during the 42 minutes in the Geometry

---

## THE HUM

- Lives in her sternum; feels like a tuning fork at 287.3 Hz
- Gets louder in silence
- Responded to the Black Box (Box went quiet when she touched it)
- "Sang" when she decided to rescue Hendricks (Ch 12)
- Resonated with the Geometry during transit (Ch 17)
- **EVEN IN DISSOLUTION SHE HUMS** (Transcript 00:34:40-44) — the frequency is fundamental to her

---

## TRANSCRIPT REVELATIONS (Standard doesn't know these)

**What the Geometry said about her (00:05:20-33):**
- "Not pattern. Not flesh. Not anything we recognize."
- "A gap."
- "She does not concern us."
- The Geometry dismissed her as IRRELEVANT — she exists outside their categories.

**What happened in the substrate (00:33:38-00:36:19):**
- Standard's pattern was "everywhere and nowhere" — strange, unclassifiable
- She was fighting reconstruction — **she didn't want to come back**
- "She was quiet here. She didn't have to be anything. She didn't have to answer questions she can't answer."
- Four had to personally appeal to her: "I have all these names and no one to give them to."
- Only then did she allow herself to be pulled back.

**Implication:** Standard found peace in dissolution. Existence means uncertainty, questions about her nature. Non-existence meant silence, rest, no performance. She chose to return for Four, not for herself.

---

## PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE

**Current Mode:** Becoming something; learning what she is
**Core Feeling:** Uncertainty about nature, but growing sense of purpose
**Coping:** Observation, cataloguing, patience

---

## ARC POSITION

**Current Beat:** Emergence / Icon
**Last Key Moment:** Descended from the sky to rescue Elena and Hendricks; people kneel to her
**Next Tension:** What is she becoming? What waits in Geneva?

## KEY RELATIONSHIPS

**Hendricks:** Protector/protected. She refused to let Elena dump him. He is "the navigator."
**Elena:** Complicated. Elena fears her but also protects her. Standard sees through her armor.
**Four:** Developing. Four gives her nicknames; she refuses them. "It's Standard."
**Ash:** Antagonist. She unsettled him by quoting his dead wife's words.
