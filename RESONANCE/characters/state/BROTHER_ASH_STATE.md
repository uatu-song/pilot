---

## KNOWLEDGE STATE

### Knows Now:
- Elena delivered the Black Box (Ch 9)
- Elena brought Hendricks — "the man who murdered the Child" (Ch 9)
- Standard exists and is immune to the signal (Ch 10-11)
- Standard quoted his dead wife Marisol's words (Ch 11)
- Elena has betrayed him — killed his guards, rescued his prisoner (Ch 14)
- His congregation knelt to Standard (Ch 14)
- Standard descended from the sky "like ascension" (Ch 14)
- The aliens arrived (vindication of his theology)
- Elena was never truly his — she kept her implant from the Miracle

### Learned in Flashback (Ch 11):
- Marisol left him for "the signal" when Elena was 7
- Marisol worked on 287.3 Hz — the "handshake" frequency
- Marisol's last words to Elena: "You have your father's face. But not your frequency."
- He built the Quiet Zone to prove Marisol wrong
- The heist was a test for Elena — Abraham and Isaac
- He saw Elena looking "different" after the Miracle but didn't understand

### Still Doesn't Know:
- What Standard truly is
- Where Elena and the others went
- Whether Marisol is alive

## PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE

**Current Mode:** Shattered certainty
**Core Feeling:** Betrayed by his daughter; challenged by something he can't categorize
**The Crack:** Standard asked "Why are you afraid of me?" — he didn't have an answer

---

## FAMILY STATUS

**Daughter (Elena):** BETRAYED HIM — openly defied, killed his guards, escaped
**Wife (Marisol):** Left when Elena was 7; location unknown; may be in Geneva consortium

---

## ARC POSITION

**Current Beat:** Post-betrayal / Broken
**Last Key Moment:** Watched his congregation kneel to Standard; Elena escaped with his prisoner
**Next Tension:** What will he do now? Pursue? Collapse? Collaborate with the Geometry?

**The Black Box:** Delivered by Elena (Ch 9)

## THEOLOGY STATUS

**Core Doctrine:** "Connection invites judgment. Silence is salvation."
**Vindication:** The Geometry's arrival proves him right about connection being dangerous
**The Problem:** Standard doesn't fit his categories — she's silent but wrong; she's not Signal but she's not his Silence either
