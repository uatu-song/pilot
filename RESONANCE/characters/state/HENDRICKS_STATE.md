**As Of:** Chapter 17 (End) — POST-TRANSCRIPT
**Last Updated:** December 25, 2025

---

## LOCATION

**Current:** Four (VTOL), cargo bay
**With:** Standard, Elena, Four (AI)
**Heading:** Geneva (clear of Geometry and Sovereignty)

---

## PHYSICAL CONDITION

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Overall | **RESTORED** — Four pulled "the version before" |
| Neck Wound | **ABSENT** — restored to pre-Regulator state |
| Strangulation | **ABSENT** — pattern variant selected |
| Hands | **STEADY** — no more tremors |
| Skin | **NORMAL** — no gray pallor |
| Fatigue | Unknown — hasn't woken since restoration |
| Consciousness | Unconscious (restored, not dying) |

**CRITICAL CHANGE (Transcript 00:32:13-00:33:32):**
Four's iterations found TWO patterns for Hendricks — "the damaged one" and "the one underneath." Four chose to pull "the version before" — giving him back what the Regulator took. His biosignature no longer matches his previous baseline:
- Cellular decay markers: ABSENT
- Regulatory implant damage: ABSENT
- Systemic deterioration: ABSENT

He doesn't know this yet. When he wakes, he will feel 40 years younger.

**Attire:**
- Unknown (likely compound clothing or medical gown)

**Inventory:**
- Nothing (revolver with Ash)

## KNOWLEDGE STATE

### Knows Now:
- Standard is an android (air-gapped)
- Morton sent her
- Elena is Ash's daughter
- Elena knows he shot the Child
- Elena rescued him from execution
- They escaped Ash's compound via VTOL
- Standard can fly
- They transited through the Geometry (42 minutes missing)
- The Sovereignty scanned them and detected Standard as "unclassified"

### Key Backstory Revealed (Ch 13):
- Loved Morton for 40 years — unrequited
- Morton gave him the Regulator to suppress his emotional responses
- Saw Pilot and Seventeen through the window to Blackbird
- The Child told him "He sees you. He just doesn't know how to say it."
- Conspired with Ash out of pain (wanted Morton to see him)
- Shot the Child as "mercy" — preventing torture Ash threatened
- Morton's last word to him was "You" — recognition at last
- Morton's actual last words were "Eggs first" — not about Hendricks

### Still Doesn't Know:
- What happened during the 42 minutes in the Geometry
- What Standard truly is
- Where Marisol (Ash's wife) went

## PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE

**Current Mode:** Near-death, dependent on others
