## CHAPTER LOG

| Ch | Location | Key Event | State Change |
|----|----------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | Apartment | Finishing self-surgery; meets Standard; **tries to abandon her — body refuses** | Post-surgery; functional but degrading; involuntary commitment |
| 2 | (not present) | — | — |
| 3 | Apartment → Checkpoint | Descends with Standard; survives Correction Frequency | Rapidly deteriorating; survives signal |
| 4 | Checkpoint → Rover | Elena loads them; collapses against Black Box | Unconscious; critical condition |

### Ch 1 Key Beat: The Threshold

Hendricks attempts to leave Standard behind ("Stay here. If you're quiet, maybe they won't find you for a few days."). Opens door. Freezes. Can't take the step. Turns back. Sees her **hands** — the will to survive. Decision made by nervous system, not mind. First crack in transactional isolation.
