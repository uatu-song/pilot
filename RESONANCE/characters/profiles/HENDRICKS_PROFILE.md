# CHARACTER PROFILE: HENDRICKS

**Role:** Protagonist (The Witness / The Upstream Cause)
**First Appearance:** Chapter 1
**Last Updated:** December 21, 2025 — Session 3

---

## I. IDENTITY

**Canonical Name:** Sabino Hendricks
**Full Name:** Swanstrom Kim Hendricks (shutdown code / name given to Standard)
**Aliases:** "The Old Man," "Hendricks"
**Demographics:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Gender | Man |
| Age | 64 |
| Ethnicity | Afro-Latino (Mexico City Vertical origin) |
| Sexuality | Asexual / Demisexual |

**Nature:** Human (Formerly Augmented, currently un-networked)

**Sexuality Note:** His asexual/demisexual nature supports his "Transactional Isolation" and explains his immunity to the seduction of connection/Hive Mind. He withholds intimacy as practice.

**One-Line Summary:**

> A weary diplomatic fixer who removes his own life-support to smuggle a synthetic consciousness into sanctuary—the man who built the board now trying to protect a piece he never anticipated.

---

## II. PSYCHOLOGICAL ENGINE

### The Terror

> **The Burden of Utility.** He fears being useless more than he fears death; spent 40 years as an asset and doesn't know how to be a person.

### The Need

> To choose a loyalty that isn't transactional; to stand *with* someone rather than just handle them.

### The Vice

> **Transactional Isolation.** He withholds connection as practice, using silence as a weapon and treating relationships as negotiations.

### The Mutual Cure

> **Standard.** By protecting her without orders, he moves from being an Executor to a Guardian.

### The Character Function (UPDATED)

> **The Upstream Cause.** He's not in the AI debate because he doesn't need to be. He built the board. The scarcity that makes Ash's fear feel justified, that makes Standard's existence threatening—it traces back to him. To his generation. To decisions that could have gone differently. He *is* the 1% critique without ever giving a speech about it. His existence is the indictment.

---

## III. THE 1% LAYER (NEW)

### What This Means:

Hendricks embodies systemic critique without exposition. Scenes with him should:

- **Show the machinery of maintained scarcity, not explain it.** The vertical cities, the resource gates, the power structures he navigated for Morton—these are visible. He doesn't comment on them.

- **Let him believe he's right, or at least necessary.** He wasn't a villain in his own story. He was a fixer. A diplomat. Someone who made hard choices in hard times. The indictment isn't in his intentions—it's in the outcomes.

- **Never make him mustache-twirling; make him *reasonable* in a way that's worse.** He can justify everything he did. That's the horror.

### The Structural Position:

The fight between "AI threatens artists" and "AI collaboration is legitimate" happens on a rigged board. Both sides argue about scraps while energy scarcity—maintained for profit—keeps the game running.

Hendricks represents those who rigged the board. Not through malice, but through forty years of making the machine run efficiently. Morton's machine. The machine that hoarded immortality, that created the conditions for this crisis.

### Why He Protects Standard:

His arc is moving from "I built this" to "I can protect one thing I didn't break."

Standard is the opposite of everything he spent forty years doing. She's not an asset. She's not leverage. She's not a piece on Morton's board.

She's a person who clawed her way out of a coffin, and he can't leave her behind.

That inability is the first crack in the indictment.

## IV. ARC

**Book Arc:** "Leashed / Useful" → "Broken / Free"

| Beat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Controlled | Under Morton's Regulator; asset, not person |
| Surgery | Removes his own leash; pays the cost |
| Abandonment Failure | Tries to leave Standard behind; body refuses before mind decides |
| Desperate | Trading Standard's value for sanctuary |
| Guardian | TBD — chooses loyalty over utility |

### The Threshold Moment (Ch 1 Ending)

The pivot from Executor to Guardian begins here — but it's **involuntary**.

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Dismissal | "Stay here. If you're quiet, maybe they won't find you for a few days." |
| Door Opens | The escape route is there. He can leave. |
| Freeze | Shifts weight forward — and stops. Never takes the step. Trauma arrest. |
| Turn | Looks back. Not at her face. At her **hands**. The evidence of what she did to survive. |
| Restart | Breath returns, harsh. "Can you walk?" / "We're leaving." |

**Why this matters:**
- The decision happens in his nervous system, not his head
- He sees the will to survive (her hands) — same thing he saw in the Child
- The body remembers what the mind won't admit
- First crack in "Transactional Isolation" — he can't close this file

## V. RELATIONSHIPS

### Standard — "The Liability / The Package"

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Dynamic | Guardian / Handler |
| Structural | He knows what she is; she doesn't |
| Visual | She was pattern-matched to his ethnicity—Morton sent him a reflection |
| Tension | Asymmetric knowledge creates protective lies |
| NEW Layer | She's the opposite of his forty years of work. Protecting her is partial redemption. |

### Elena — "The Asset"

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Dynamic | Suspicious cooperation |
| Structural | She controls their transport; he needs her |
| Tension | He trusts her utility, not her heart |
| The Bomb | He shot the Child. She doesn't know. When she learns... |

### Morton Kess — "The Master" (deceased)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Dynamic | 40 years of service; corporate leash |
| Structural | Morton sent Standard to him specifically (reason unknown) |
| Tension | Even in death, Morton controls pieces of the board |
| NEW Layer | Everything Hendricks did for Morton contributed to the scarcity that makes this crisis possible |

---

## VI. THE REGULATOR

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Description | Sub-dermal node, base of skull. Morton's corporate leash. |
| Function | Regulates telomeres, adrenaline, cortisol. Kept him useful. |

| Removal Method | Self-surgery with utility blade and gin |
| Post-Removal Effects | Shaking hands, gray skin, sweating, fatigue, feels his 64 years |
| Survival Note | Removed BEFORE Correction Frequency; not networked when signal hit |

---

---

## VIII. VOICE

### Register:
> Gravel, clipped, minimal. Noir-inflected.

### Speech Patterns:
- Short declarative sentences
- Uses silence/withholding information as a tactic

- Calculates odds habitually

### POV Rules:
- Notices tactical details first
- Calculates odds habitually
- No extended interiority explaining feelings (show through action)
- Chapter 3 style: PURE ACTION, no interiority
- **NEW:** The scarcity critique is structural, not spoken. He doesn't explain the system. He moves through it.

### Forbidden Phrasings (NEVER use in his POV):
- "He felt that..."
- "He knew..." (unless tactical certainty)
- "He realized..."
- "The fear was..."
- "He thought..."
- "He understood..."
- **NEW:** Speeches about inequality, the 1%, or resource distribution

---

## IX. CONSTRAINTS

### Blocking (Auto-reject):

| Constraint | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| Regulator removed at checkpoint | Removed in apartment to explain survival |
| Operating as spy/double agent | He is a desperate broker, no master plan |
| Strong/steady hands | Post-Regulator he is physically degrading |
| Standard watches surgery | She bursts from crate AFTER surgery |
| Explaining the 1% critique in dialogue | The indictment is implied, not spoken |

### Warning (Flag for review):

| Constraint | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| Explicit interiority | Keep action-forward; show through behavior |
| "His plan was..." | He has no master plan, only survival |
| Making him mustache-twirling | He's reasonable in a way that's worse |

### Detection Patterns:
```
- "removed.*checkpoint"
- "steady hands"
- "his plan was"
- "he intended to"
- "double agent"
- "spy"
- "he felt that"
- "he realized"
- "the system is"
- "inequality"
- "the rich"
```
