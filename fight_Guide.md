# Writing excellent fight scenes: Comprehensive techniques for prose fiction

**The secret to great fight scene writing isn't mastering choreography—it's mastering clarity, character, and consequence.** The most successful action writers from Brandon Sanderson to Joe Abercrombie share a counterintuitive insight: readers don't want blow-by-blow technical combat descriptions. They want visceral, character-driven experiences that advance the story while remaining clear enough to follow. After analyzing techniques from master practitioners and writing craft resources, the essential principle emerges: write the *experience* of fighting, not just the mechanics of it.

This matters because fight scenes represent some of the highest-stakes moments in fiction, yet they're also where many writers lose their readers through confusion, tedium, or disconnection from character. The difference between skippable combat and page-turning action lies in applying specific, learnable techniques. The foundation is simpler than you'd think: focus on your viewpoint character's immediate experience, back away from action every 2-3 beats to add breathing room, and ensure every fight serves your story. Everything else builds from there.

## Managing large-scale choreography without losing readers

**Brandon Sanderson explicitly avoids using physical models during action sequences because they tempt him to "describe things happening across the action sequence all over, rather than what is immediately happening to the viewpoint character—which is where my focus needs to be."** This reveals the core insight for handling multiple combatants: don't try to show everything happening everywhere. The solution to tracking 4+ characters fighting simultaneously is counterintuitive—you maintain clarity by narrowing focus, not widening it.

The limited awareness strategy embraces what actually happens in real combat. When multiple people are fighting, the POV character will have only a partial, haphazard understanding of where everyone else is and what they're doing. **A fight of any scale will be confused for the protagonists once they're in the thick of it.** Rather than fighting this reality, successful writers lean into it. You stay tight on your viewpoint character's immediate experience—what they can see, hear, and sense in their immediate vicinity—and use sound to suggest broader action happening nearby. The clanking of swords, the hissing of arrows, distant explosions all convey scale without requiring you to describe events your character can't witness.

Before the battle begins, however, you must establish the overall situation. Setting the scene before action starts pays enormous dividends later. Good writers lay this groundwork well in advance, sometimes having characters visit the scene in an earlier chapter. Readers won't remember exact furniture placement or precise barricade positions, but they will remember that cliff you're about to throw someone over, or the pool of acid your villain is about to fall into. These memorable landmarks become reference points during chaos. When mapping out complex battles, many writers use physical tools—drawing maps, using toy soldiers or buttons to block out positions—but these planning aids never make it directly onto the page.

During the fight itself, structure matters more than exhaustive detail. The three-beat rule, identified across multiple master writers from Chuck Palahniuk to J.R.R. Tolkien to Orson Scott Card, provides the rhythm: **give 2-3 sentences of action maximum, then back away** with sensory details, character thoughts, or emotional reactions. This pattern forces you to focus on large, visualizable movements rather than minutiae, prevents reader overwhelm, and creates natural breathing space. Palahniuk gives 1-2 sentences of action then dives deep into physical sensations. Tolkien provides panoramic battle views, briefly focuses on two characters, then backs out to description. Card uses three sentences of action, shifts to character's internal thoughts, then returns to action.

For clarity with multiple combatants, use distinctive fighting styles and weapons for each character you're tracking. Readers can follow "the one with the spear" versus "the knife fighter" versus "the one throwing magic" much more easily than "he" versus "he" versus "the other he." These visual distinctions help readers track who's doing what without requiring constant name repetition. Additionally, Joe Abercrombie demonstrates another technique in "The Heroes"—the chapter titled "Casualties" follows the battle person to person up the hill, with language getting tighter and tighter as the fight progresses. By the end, you're just about as breathless as the characters. This "camera pan" technique shows slices of the larger battle through sequential individual perspectives.

The action-reaction structure provides moment-to-moment clarity. Vivian Sayan's formula works reliably: **Action** (external move the character can sense) → **Instinctive Reaction** (emotional or unconscious physical response like flinching) → **Deliberate Reaction** (conscious movement or decision) → **Thoughts** (internal monologue if appropriate for POV). This order matters because it mirrors how humans actually experience combat. Example: "The axe slashes through the air and pierces her skin. Panic floods her as she howls in pain. She gasps in air, struggling to gather her wits and push past the pain. Tears in her eyes, she raises her sword with her remaining hand. That fucker is going down!" The sequence feels natural and keeps readers oriented.

## Controlling pacing and rhythm through prose technique

**The fundamental problem with fight scene pacing is that in film, action washes over viewers passively, but in prose, readers must actively construct the scene in their minds from textual clues—this is mentally exhausting.** Managing this cognitive load while maintaining momentum requires understanding how sentence structure controls speed. The counterintuitive truth: short sentences are read *slower* (more emphasis), while longer sentences with multiple clauses read *faster*. This means the conventional wisdom to "always use short sentences for fast pacing" is incomplete.

To speed up action, use short, punchy sentences with active voice, strong verbs, minimal adjectives, and sentence fragments used sparingly. Single-line paragraphs create impact. "She ducked. He swung. The blade whistled past her ear. Blood. She tasted blood." The white space on the page makes the reader's eyes move faster, creating urgency. But to slow down and add breathing room, employ longer sentences with multiple clauses, pull the camera back to wider perspective, add atmospheric details, and include character reflection. "The battlefield stretched before them, littered with the broken remnants of what had been, just hours ago, an army. Smoke curled from scattered fires, and somewhere in the distance, someone was screaming."

The key is variation, not uniformity. Create rhythm through mixing: long sentence (builds tension) → short sentence (impact) → medium sentence (transition) → fragment (punctuation). Brandon Sanderson adjusts sentence structure based on tone and character skill. A skilled fighter cutting through enemies gets longer, more lyrical sentences to show flow and ease: "His sword cut a sly path before him, darting between rib and collarbone..." A frantic, desperate fight demands short sentences and fragments. He links short clauses into longer sentences to indicate quick pacing without choppiness.

Strategic decisions about when to speed up versus slow down shape reader experience. **Speed up during:** peak action moments, rapid exchanges, when the character is overwhelmed, building to a crescendo, or showing trained fighters whose movements are efficient and quick. **Slow down during:** the buildup before fighting begins, strategic moments where the character assesses and plans, after major impacts to show consequences and realization, at turning points to make important moments stand out, when the character is exhausted, or when building suspense (sometimes slowing heightens tension).

The rollercoaster principle recognizes that good pacing isn't constant speed. The build-up, the anticipation, and the plummet are equally important. Don't mistake constant acceleration for good pacing—the slow climb makes the drop thrilling. This means alternating tempos: action beat → emotional beat → plot twist beat → emotional beat → action beat. This prevents monotony and one-note cacophony while keeping audiences engaged through variety.

Building intensity without exhausting readers requires strategic escalation rather than forced escalation. Start smaller with manageable stakes and action. Layer complications progressively. Raise stakes with each beat, making consequences worse. Connect to character investment by tying action to what characters care about. Create setbacks following the pattern: forward progress, then complication, then harder progress. Before your climactic peak, include an "all is lost" moment where success seems impossible. This reminds readers of opening goals, shows character desire tested, resets anticipation, and makes final triumph more satisfying.

The most practical guidance for avoiding reader fatigue: **keep individual fights short—1-2 pages maximum unless exceptionally well-crafted.** Real fights lasting under 30 seconds when both parties commit fully. There are only so many kicks and punches readers can process before yawning. Mix action with dialogue to break up description, but keep combat dialogue concise (short sentences, single words). Avoid introspection during peak action—reflection happens before and after fights, not during. During fighting, brief flashes of thought work well, but don't pause for lengthy internal monologues. Most importantly, vary your approach across different fights: some quick and brutal, some strategic and tense, some emotional and desperate, some darkly humorous.

## Writing coordinated team attacks and tactical cooperation

**Groups bring communication, coordination, tactics, strategy, and the ability to limit movement—they circle, use each other as distractions, and come at angles opponents can't defend well.** The challenge in writing team combat is making the coordination itself the spectacle, not just individual badassery. Military science fiction writing guides emphasize that fireteams (3-4 members) are the basic coordinated unit, while squads (6-13 members) allow flexible tactical deployment. When one team provides covering fire while another flanks, this creates natural action beats in your writing.

The distraction-and-strike pattern forms the foundation of coordinated attacks. Character A engages enemy attention (suppressive fire, frontal assault), Characters B and C maneuver to advantageous positions, a coordination moment occurs (signal, shout, or understood timing), then simultaneous strikes come from multiple angles. Crucially, don't describe every blow—focus on the *coordination* itself: the nod, the timing, the way one character's action creates an opening for another. Example: "Marcus pinned the guard's blade. That was all Elena needed—she struck, fast and final." The connection between actions matters more than technical details of each strike.

Brandon Sanderson's heist-team model in Mistborn demonstrates this principle through magic design. He originally conceived the crew as specialists working together like Ocean's Eleven, with each Allomancer having one specific power (Mistings). This forces coordination: "You'd be lucky to even get one Mistborn, so you need specialists." Different powers complement each other, creating natural combination moves. This design philosophy applies broadly—give each team member distinct capabilities (different weapons, fighting styles, tactical roles) that necessitate cooperation rather than individual dominance.

Communication during combat requires understanding the constraints. Verbally, brevity under fire is essential: short sentences, simple words, clear orders. Combat accelerates—there's no time for eloquence. Military principle structures communication: Observation ("Contact, three o'clock!") → Assessment ("Hostiles, estimate six") → Decision ("Team Two, suppress. Team One, flank right") → Execution (action follows). This sequence creates urgency when written with new actions on new lines. The visual pacing reinforces the rapid-fire nature.

Non-verbal communication becomes crucial when verbal is impossible or dangerous. Hand signals are limited to basic messages and require line of sight. More effectively, experienced teams fight by instinct: "If you've been fighting with them a long time, you'll move together instinctively, protect each other's backs." Positional awareness lets fighters coordinate without explicit signals. Sound cues work powerfully: "The machine gun fell silent. That was the signal." Environmental indicators like shadows shifting on walls, body language signaling tension before action, and gaze direction indicating targets or threats all convey coordination without words.

The key to showing tactical thinking while maintaining momentum: **plan before combat, execute during combat.** Brief planning scenes establish strategy, discuss contingencies ("If they flank, fall back to position two"), and show competence without mid-battle exposition. During combat, tactical adjustments happen through *action*, not thought. "She saw the opening and moved" not "She thought about the opening." Decisions happen at combat speed. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) let established teams use practiced responses with minimal communication, creating a "groove" readers can follow while demonstrating competence. When SOPs fail, tension naturally rises.

Character roles in team fights follow recognizable patterns adapted from gaming and military structure. **Defender/Tank** draws enemy attention, absorbs damage, protects teammates—often taking leadership role with protective instincts and tactical awareness. **Striker/DPS** delivers maximum damage to single targets, exploits openings with high accuracy, adapts to enemy weaknesses. **Controller** uses area effects, disrupts enemy formations, denies terrain. **Leader/Support** coordinates, buffs allies, provides tactical advantages beyond just healing—the one who sees the whole battlefield and calls plays. These roles should emerge from character abilities and personalities rather than rigid job descriptions. Role failures create drama, and flexibility under pressure shows competence.

The rotating focus technique balances individual moments within team fights. Follow different characters for 2-3 action beats, return to establish continuity, ensure each character gets a "hero moment." Better yet, use interconnected actions where Character A's success enables Character B's opportunity. Post-combat reflection offers brief moments where the team discusses what happened, validating everyone's contribution without stopping action flow. The spatial arrangement of team combat also matters: formations like wedge (unknown enemy direction), column (speed over security), skirmish line (maximum forward firepower), or V-formation (protecting rear) create tactical variety and visual interest when described through character action rather than technical exposition.

## Weaponizing environment and compensating for power imbalances

**If your fight scene doesn't take place in a hot air balloon, it probably should.** This provocative principle from writing craft resources emphasizes that pushing circumstances makes fights interesting through environmental constraints. A fight in an open field is boring and overused. The same field during an earthquake with ground opening beneath fighters becomes dynamic and unpredictable. The environment should function as an active character in combat, not mere backdrop.

Physical constraints shape fighting fundamentally. Tight spaces like tunnels or alleyways force different fighting styles—the confined setting makes battle more visceral, with characters tripping on bodies and slipping in blood as they're jostled in cramped quarters. Slippery surfaces, unstable ground, and limited visibility each create distinct challenges. Environmental weapons multiply tactical options: bottles grabbed and smashed, boiling stew thrown from passing servers, furniture used as shields or projectiles. R.F. Kuang's approach in The Poppy War demonstrates this—terrain and weather shape battle outcomes, with environment functioning as weapon, obstacle, and tension source simultaneously rather than decorative description.

Urban combat specifically provides three-dimensional tactical complexity. Multi-level buildings enable vertical envelopment opportunities. The tactical space extends 300 meters squared covering most weapons ranges, incorporating CBD buildings and spaces between structures. This requires "spherical security"—all-round awareness in three dimensions, looking vertically, horizontally, and spatially simultaneously. Urban environments offer innumerable ready-made defensible positions, simple escape routes, transport access contrasted with complex terrain, sniper positions, ambush points, and elevated advantages. The guerrilla principle applies: "The guerrillas must move amongst the people as a fish swims in the sea." Blending into urban populations, using civilian infrastructure as cover, means superior force must navigate populated areas more carefully, creating tactical opportunities for weaker combatants.

For David versus Goliath scenarios, the essential principle: **the Israelites measured themselves against Goliath and despaired; David measured Goliath against God and had confidence.** The weaker combatant must measure the challenge against their own advantages (speed, cleverness, environment, coordination) rather than accepting the stronger opponent's terms of engagement. Historical examples like the English longbow at Crécy, Greek phalanx formations, and the Battle of Thermopylae demonstrate how tactical or technological advantages offset raw numbers or power.

Asymmetric warfare tactics provide the weaker side multiple compensatory options. Superior training and tactics like specialized formations or unexpected techniques. Environmental exploitation—using terrain advantage as at Thermopylae, or urban guerrilla warfare where the weaker side's simpler infrastructure becomes an advantage while the superior power's vulnerable infrastructure becomes liability. Coordination over power, where team tactics compensate for individual weakness. Cleverness and deception—feigning weakness when strong, appearing strong when weak, using unconventional tactics the stronger opponent doesn't expect, surprise attacks, ambushes, and hit-and-run strategies.

Brandon Sanderson's approach illuminates this: **"I look at what resources the character has, what they are trying to achieve, who they are and how that influences their actions."** Focus on character resources over raw power. Make action problem-solving driven rather than strength-driven. Show how magic systems, technology, or environment can be exploited. This transforms fights from simple power comparisons into intellectual puzzles.

Pushing characters to their limits creates the gray area between victory and defeat that makes readers think "Wait, they might not survive this." Remove advantages: dominant hand injured for skilled fighter, speed-reliant character gets leg injury, cavalryman's horse falls mid-battle, flying character grounded by wing injury, magical character runs out of spells. Create environmental disadvantages: fighter operates in unfamiliar terrain, superior force trapped in confined space, weather conditions favor the weaker side. The key is making victory feel earned through intelligence and adaptation rather than plot armor.

Scott Lynch's The Lies of Locke Lamora exemplifies this approach—the protagonist isn't physically imposing, but cleverness and desperation shine through, showing weaker combatants winning through wit. The Harry Potter trio demonstrates team compensation: Hermione brings bookish knowledge, Harry excels in defensive spells, Ron provides physical combat strength, making three together perfect when each alone would be vulnerable.

## Choosing and managing point of view during battles

**Point of view management fundamentally affects tension, clarity, and emotional impact while offering distinct trade-offs.** The core decision between single and multiple POV shapes everything else. Single POV creates the "sweaty, half-panicked, act-before-you-think excitement" of being in a fight, providing immediacy, emotional engagement, simplicity, and realistic limitation that mirrors actual fighting experience. You can't track everything happening around you in real combat. This limited knowledge creates genuine suspense—readers only know what the POV character knows. However, single POV limits scope, creates information gaps, and presents pacing challenges if the POV character is sidelined or knocked unconscious.

Multiple POV enables scope and scale, showing simultaneous action across large battlefields, providing strategic perspective so readers understand the bigger picture, creating dramatic irony where readers know things individual characters don't, shifting to whoever has most to lose at each moment, and building rich complexity through varied perspectives. The disadvantages include complexity management that can confuse readers with frequent switches, reduced intimacy because each perspective gets less page time, pacing disruption when cutting from high action to slower moments, and risk of confusion where readers lose track of positions and actions.

George RR Martin's approach demonstrates masterful multiple POV management. He uses nine POV characters in 280,000 words but **only switches at chapter breaks**, with each chapter titled with the POV character's name for absolute clarity. He chooses POV based on "emotional impact" and "most potential drama," varying battle presentation to avoid repetition. For three consecutive battles in the first book, he fully dramatized the first from a POV character in action, showed the second where the POV character *hears* battle more than sees it, and presented the third through dialogue when a courier reports results. This variation prevents readers from "slogging through endless passages of swords slashing."

The distinction between deep POV and cinematic POV matters enormously. Deep POV (limited third or first person) means readers experience the scene AS the character, with full access to thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations filtered through character personality and voice. In combat, this requires accounting for adrenaline effects: fight-or-flight response, tunnel vision, time distortion, dulled pain, limited emotional range during active fighting. Characters react before conscious thought; experienced fighters move on muscle memory. Fear happens *before* the fight—during fighting, only "will to continue and drive to survive" remain. This creates visceral, immersive reader experience and allows "skating past gaps in technical expertise," but limits room for context during action and makes conveying complex tactics difficult.

Cinematic POV (distant third or omniscient) offers camera-like observation that can show what any character is doing, with more room for technical detail and tactical overview, less subjective and more reportorial. It provides flexibility and can show the "big picture" of complex battles, but loses emotional immediacy and risks feeling more like telling than showing. Modern readers typically prefer closer POV. **Barry Lyga warns that cinematic POV is "not really a perspective at all"—it lacks the subjectivity, opinions, and human element that true perspective provides.**

Managing POV transitions during action requires strategic thinking about *when* and *how* to switch. Good reasons to switch: previous POV character knocked out or incapacitated, action moves to a location where POV character isn't present, different character now has highest stakes, strategic need to show enemy perspective, or building dramatic irony about converging threats. Poor reasons: just to show "cool action" elsewhere, to info-dump tactical information, because it's been a while since last switch, or pattern dictates it even though nothing important is happening.

The execution method matters as much as the decision. Chapter breaks provide the cleanest, clearest signal to readers and are preferred for most genre fiction. Scene breaks using "###" or centered symbols work well but require immediate establishment of new POV in the first sentence. More advanced techniques like the "baton pass" (action or object passes between characters) or omniscient bridge (pull back to omniscient for a paragraph, zoom into different character) require considerable skill and should be used sparingly.

**Critical insight from FightWrite: When writing combat in close POV, you must account for adrenaline effects.** Adrenaline causes tunnel vision (focus only on threat, peripheral dims), sensory changes (unless greatly exaggerated, sounds/smells/sights fade), limited pain (won't feel full pain until adrenaline fades), dulled emotions, time distortion, diminished critical thinking, weakened fine motor skills, memory gaps, and possible blackouts. Writing implications: character cannot do complex tactical thinking while actively fighting, can't notice everything around them, experienced fighters act on muscle memory not planning, may not comprehend their injuries ("may not comprehend their arm has been chomped off"), and post-fight pain and emotion hit hard.

Dorothy Dunnett's approach in The Game of Kings demonstrates that sometimes the most interesting POV isn't the combatant. In a duel scene, she uses omniscient POV that "perches from time to time on the shoulder" of observers but never enters the protagonist Lymond's head. This allows technical swordplay details through trained observers, shows amazement for untrained readers, provides tactical commentary, maintains suspense about what Lymond will do next, and "deploys all these things like a conductor with a symphony." Similarly, Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel series shows warrior Joscelin's battles from observer Phedre's first-person POV, allowing complex emotional stakes and consequences to remain central while physical combat happens.

## The mistakes that kill fight scenes

**The single most deadly mistake is turn-based combat narration**—writing as if combatants take turns, with one side doing everything they need to do before it's the other side's turn to act. This destroys realism, is both comical and frustrating, and makes readers wonder why each side lets the other take actions without interference. The problem stems from the difficulty of describing simultaneous actions using linear text. Fix this using transitional phrases like "while," "as," "at the same moment," breaking actions into smaller overlapping segments, showing reactions happening *during* (not after) actions, and practicing describing one-versus-many combat where multiple attacks come "nearly simultaneously."

Confusing spatial positioning—losing track of where characters are relative to each other, obstacles, and other fighters—breaks immersion when positioning doesn't make physical sense. The infamous example: a character swinging their sword over their right shoulder where their friend is standing, effectively beheading them. Readers get lost and can't visualize what's happening. **Solutions are practical: draw it out like football plays with X's and O's, map the location first marking available space and obstacles, stand up and physically orient your body to test if moves are possible, use consistent directional references, and avoid overusing "right" and "left" unless critical.**

Fights that go on too long become tedious. Real fights last 20-40 seconds maximum when both parties put in full effort. Multi-page blow-by-blow descriptions cause readers to get bored and skip scenes. Keep individual fights short (not pages long), use shorter sentences to speed pace, cut non-essential details after first drafts, mix action with dialogue, and focus on pivotal moments rather than every single blow. Think about which moves would be illustrated in a comic book—only show the "gross movements" rather than every micro-adjustment.

The blow-by-blow overload manifests as endless streams: "He swung his sword from left to right, raking the tip across his foe's shield. He brought back his blade quickly to parry a counterattack, then launched one of his own..." This gets boring by the third or fourth paragraph. Technical choreography becomes tedious in large battle scenes, when outcome is already clear, or when you're more focused on showing off writing skill than moving plot forward. Blow-by-blow works for one-on-one duels where intimacy matters, climactic final battles, when interspersed with dialogue and internal thoughts, and when balanced—a few paragraphs here and there, not pages.

Too much introspection during action slows pace to a crawl. In real fights there's no time for reflection. Introspection happens before and after fights, not during. Save reflection for before and after, use brief fragmented thoughts if absolutely necessary, and focus on immediate sensory experience and instinctive reactions. Conversely, too little sensory detail makes scenes feel flat and unengaging. **Activate all five senses:** sight, hearing (ringing in ears, grunts, clash of metal), taste (blood, dust), touch (pain, impact, temperature), and smell (sweat, blood, environmental scents).

Characters having full conversations or delivering paragraphs of dialogue mid-combat creates the impression everyone has paused to listen, destroys credibility, and turns serious battles into comedic farces. Try talking while running or being punched—speech is a luxury you mostly can't afford. Every second of distraction could be fatal. Hand-to-hand combat allows a few words at most (grunts, profanity, short insults). Gun fights can handle an entire sentence here and there as characters duck behind cover. Insert dialogue during natural pauses: when combatant is cornered, slowed by injury, forced to surrender, loses weapon, or someone enters and disrupts action. Fighters naturally create pauses because fighting is exhausting.

Ignoring basic body mechanics creates physically impossible movements. Examples include punching with right hand while stepping with left foot (balance doesn't work), catching a leg then delivering an elbow strike to an unreachable position, character on all fours after being knocked down (leaves head and ribs open for kicks), fingers wrapped over thumb in fist (thumb will break), or high kicks being easy and safe (they compromise balance and are easy to catch). **Fix this by researching actual fighting techniques watching MMA fights, standing up and physically testing movements, understanding that punching requires whole body behind it for power, knowing that kicks especially high ones leave you vulnerable, and researching period clothing and armor constraints if writing historical combat.**

Unrealistic injury response—characters getting seriously injured but continuing to fight as if nothing happened—badly disconnects readers from stories. Getting punched really hurts; characters stumble backwards, see spots, hear ringing, feel bones snapping. After one-third gallon blood loss, rapid heart rate, confusion, weakness, shallow breathing, blood pressure difficulties, and medical shock occur. Broken bones cause horrible pain. Head injuries even "knocked out" cause serious concussions with lasting effects. Make characters feel the fight during and after, show stumbling and sensory disruption, account for adrenaline (lessens pain response, enhances clotting) but don't treat it as a superpower, and don't have characters shake off head shots, broken bones, or stab wounds.

Gratuitous fight scenes that don't move story forward or reveal character feel like filler. Readers sense when fights exist only to show off fancy moves or writing skills. **The test: delete the fight scene, read the scene before and after—can you still make sense of what happened? If yes, the fight might be unnecessary.** Ensure every fight causes some transition (physical or mental), use fights to reveal character motivation, fighting style, stakes, fears, or weaknesses, show how choices reinforce characterization, and make sure fights advance plot, develop character, or reveal worldbuilding.

Characters who never get tired remove tension. Exhaustion is crucial in real combat. Show progressive exhaustion: breathing becomes labored, movements slower, strikes weaker. Describe sweat, burning muscles, shaking arms. Mistakes increase as characters tire. Even well-trained fighters get tired—adrenaline doesn't last forever. Forgetting weapons and equipment creates realism breaks. Don't ignore how armor restricts movement, weapons cause fatigue, wet ground affects footing, or shooting guns indoors causes hearing damage. Research actual weight and handling of weapons, consider how shields and heavy weapons create exhaustion faster, and remember historical combat often avoided high kicks for practical reasons.

Passive voice and weak verbs create flat, uninteresting prose that slows pacing. Search for "was" in drafts and eliminate 95% of instances. Find stronger, more active verbs. "His arm ached with the weight of the sword" beats "the sword felt heavy." Flowery language during action drags pace and contradicts combat immediacy. Delete every word you can, remove elaborate prose, cut unnecessary adjectives and adverbs, and find good nouns and verbs that do the work. The dichotomy of making action character-driven—fight scenes without character voice read like technical manuals regardless of POV. Filter action through character perspective and personality, let trained versus untrained fighters describe and experience fights differently, and use language and rhythm matching character voice.

## How the masters do it: Author-specific techniques and examples

**Brandon Sanderson's three core principles for action scenes form the foundation that everything else builds upon.** First, **clarity above all**—if readers can't follow what's happening, they can't enjoy it. Setup is critical: establish how many combatants, their positions relative to each other, and the environment before action begins. Maintain clear blocking (sense of where characters are moving). Focus on the viewpoint character's perspective—don't try to show everything happening everywhere. Second, balance blow-by-blow description. Long streams of "he swung, he parried, he thrust" become tedious. Intersperse choreography with internal thoughts, dialogue, sensory details, and strategic observations. A few paragraphs of action, then pull back. Keep the story progressing—don't get lost in moments. Third, show don't just tell. Use concrete specific details rather than vague descriptions with occasional sensory cues.

Sanderson makes action scenes exciting through cleverness with magic and environment manipulation, raising questions during fights ("Why is this character fighting this way? Where are reinforcements?"), and reintroducing abilities during combat since action is the best place to remind readers how powers work. His pacing strategy avoids making action too long especially at book openings, but sometimes dramatic battles are necessary to hook readers. The solution: make fights serve multiple purposes simultaneously (introduce magic system, establish character relationships, raise plot questions).

His sentence structure approach reveals sophisticated thinking about combat prose. For a skilled fighter cutting through enemies easily, use **longer, more lyrical sentences to show flow and ease**: "His sword cut a sly path before him, darting between rib and collarbone..." For frantic desperate fights, use short sentences and fragments. Link short clauses into longer sentences to indicate quick pacing without choppiness. Sanderson visualizes scenes like film in his head before writing, but does not use physical models or maps for choreography (exception: large-scale battles with real warfare tactics), believing "good storytelling trumps cartography." His favorite fights in his own work are "two Mistborn fighting in the rain and mist"—he prefers the beauty and poetry of magical duels over mass combat. He developed Allomancy specifically to create poetic, flowing battle scenes that feel "visceral, earthy, and very dangerous" while maintaining "slightly larger than life" appeal.

**Joe Abercrombie's primary goal: "Give the reader the feeling of being down there with the characters, of really seeing the events, feeling them even, from the point of view of the people involved."** He deliberately focuses on the chaos, randomness, confusion, and terror of combat rather than epic fantasy's typical focus on "the massive, the epic, the world." Even in massive battles, he stays in individual character heads to ground readers in personal experience. His key techniques include making combat feel visceral and earthy while maintaining fantasy's larger-than-life quality, always asking yourself if descriptions feel truthful and authentic ("Are you really describing the thing as it is, or reaching for an easy cliché?"), and avoiding generic fantasy combat tropes.

His pacing philosophy: "Drop your reader in the midst of the action, and let them find their own way out." He asks about every scene, every paragraph, every line and every word if it's really necessary—if not, cut. Never waste time on anything you yourself find dull. If you're having trouble transitioning from Scene A to Scene B, don't—use a scene break (asterisk) or switch POV rather than dragging readers through boring transitions. Abercrombie finds action-based sequences easier to write than slower character moments and can "smash out" an action scene in a couple days. He often writes scenes as if seeing them from character's eyes, then as an observer, working character personality, skills, and shortcomings into every combat moment. Not all characters react the same to violence—show appropriate responses based on their experience.

**Jim Butcher's story skeleton applies directly to fights:** WHEN [event happens], protagonist pursues a goal, BUT WILL HE SUCCEED when [antagonist provides opposition]? Every fight scene should fit this structure. He plans a huge dramatic confrontation for the end of the middle section, building everything toward this "Great Big Middle Event" where he "really lays out the fireworks" and hits "the reader with everything you can." This works in every book he's published. His approach was heavily influenced by cinema, particularly studying fight choreography in films. With 15+ years martial arts experience across multiple disciplines (Ryukyu Kempo, Tae Kwon Do, Gojo Shorei Ryu, kung fu) plus skilled horseback riding with stunt experience, this practical knowledge informs the physical reality of his combat.

Butcher uses try-fail cycles within action sequences where each failure builds tension and sets up triumph. Heroes fail intelligently—making calculated attempts and learning from mistakes rather than random flailing. He emphasizes that creating emotion involves "paying attention to the things that cause emotions in you." When something causes strong emotion in media, stop and analyze why, then apply those lessons to your action scenes. Fight scenes reveal character through choices under pressure—what characters say during fights shows personality, motivations, and relationships because under stress, character truth emerges.

**John Gwynne's personal mantra "Epic and Intimate" captures his balance:** sweeping grand vistas and conflicts larger than border disputes (epic) combined with connecting to characters so readers care what happens to them (intimate). His regular participation in Viking battle re-enactments where he stands in the shield wall with his sons provides practical experience that adds a "layer of authenticity" unavailable otherwise. He learns how difficult it is to get into mail, how heavy armor feels, tricks to alleviate weight on shoulders, using shields as weapons and defensive tools, and authentic period combat techniques. This ensures combat feels true to the historical/fantasy period while character skill-set and personality inform every fight move.

Gwynne's influences shape his approach significantly. Bernard Cornwell: "No-one writes a battle scene like Cornwell"—he studies Cornwell's historical battle writing to learn pacing and visceral detail. David Gemmell's flawed, human characters who still embody courage and heroism demonstrate character-driven combat. Films like Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan that "stripped the glory out of battle and showed the horror and pain" with visceral, real feeling inform his aesthetic. His writing process involves visualizing scenes like films before writing, ensuring combat feels authentic to the time period, character personality, and character skill-set, then writing what he sees. He "puts on the POV head that will be engaged in the scene," walks through it mentally as if seeing from their eyes, then views again as an observer to keep combat grounded in character perspective.

The three-panel rule identified across multiple master writers provides universal application. **Give no more than three "comic book panels" of action before pulling back** with sensory detail, internal thought, dialogue, or strategic observation. This works because it forces focus on large movements easier to visualize, prevents tedious blow-by-blow choreography, fills "dead space" with character development, and keeps readers in the scene rather than lost in mechanics. Chuck Palahniuk in Fight Club focuses heavily on sensory experience with less actual blow-by-blow combat. Tolkien in Two Towers writes mass siege as viewed from above with focus on two characters' actions within larger battle, using heavy emphasis on visual sensory details that require no fight training to follow. Orson Scott Card in Ender's Game backs away after three sentences maximum, going into fighters' heads with more emphasis on psychology than choreography.

**Mark Lawrence's "art of brutal prose"** features visceral, simple, evocative style "like a punch in the gut," eschewing traditional fantasy wordiness. Simple language conveys harsh reality without mincing, fast pacing draws readers headlong through violence, and he doesn't overexplain or soften. This creates urgency and forward momentum, depicts bloodshed without glorifying it, while ambition and revenge drive action rather than heroic ideals.

**Pierce Brown's cinematic grandeur** in Red Rising cleverly fuses Roman mythology with science fiction, pacing action scenes for "slow-burn build to a hold-your-breath final act." His plot is his "most breathtaking strength" where "every action seems to flow into the next." Influenced by ancient history (Roman invasion of Britain, Boudicca's revolt, Caesar's Gallic War) and describing his vision as "Lawrence of Arabia in space," he writes layered, flawed characters whose combat reveals depth and moral complexity. Violence changes characters—he explores this transformation rather than treating combat as consequence-free spectacle.

**Evan Winter's military fantasy mastery** in Rage of Dragons creates "scintillating, immersive, vivid, ferocious and cinematic" fight scenes described as "visceral, bloody masterpieces." His extended, realistic training montages let readers experience growth alongside characters over years of grueling work rather than overnight transformation. These training scenes are some of the most engaging parts. Combat characteristics include "really drawing the reader in and making them feel the intense atmosphere of the battlefield" where readers feel fear, confusion, anger, and pure will to survive. His intense pacing mirrors protagonist emotions, feeling "intense and blurred." Time passes but doesn't feel that way due to scene momentum. Each fight serves purpose and propels story forward with vivid battle scenes placing readers in the middle. Often compared to Pierce Brown's Red Rising for pacing, Winter's revenge motivation drives relentless forward momentum grounded in African-inspired military culture.

The universal formula for great combat writing that emerges across all these authors: write the *experience* of fighting, not just the mechanics. Ground action in clear character perspective. Use varied pacing and sentence structure deliberately. Balance action with thought, dialogue, and sensory detail. Ensure every fight serves larger narrative purpose. Make readers feel the chaos while maintaining clarity. Draw from real experience or research for authenticity, and remember that emotional stakes trump physical ones. Whether writing a duel between Mistborn, a shield wall clash, or a wizard's firefight in Chicago, these techniques provide a toolkit for crafting action scenes readers won't skip—they'll devour them.
