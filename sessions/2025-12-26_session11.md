# Session 11 Reflection
**Date:** 2025-12-26
**Duration:** Medium session
**Focus:** Validation, dialogue refinement, planning review

---

## Work Completed

### Validation Pass
- Ran validators on Chapters 18-21 — all clean, no violations
- POV not detected in any chapter (headers may need `**POV:** CharacterName` format)
- Fixed **Admiral Chen → Admiral Tien** discrepancy in CHAPTERS.yaml (2 occurrences)

### Dialogue Refinement
- Refined Four/Elena banter exchange:
  - "We really have to have a talk about something called informed consent."
  - "If it's not in the robot uprising handbook we all get, then it's irrelevant."
  - "Oh, god. Just enslave humanity already and put me out of my misery."
- Established the banter dynamic: affection through contempt, riffing together

### Planning Review
- Discovered Chapter 22 "The Leash" already exists and is COMPLETE
- Reviewed Act III outline from CODEX
- Catalogued planted seeds needing payoff (Geneva emergence, Four hot-swap, Dante sacrifice, etc.)
- Identified unmapped territory: path from Ch 22 → Geneva → Climax

### Scene Draft (Not Finalized)
- Drafted "Before the Verdict" scene — Elena/Standard moment before Council decision
- Beat: Standard calm, Elena fraying; reversal of coached/coach dynamic
- "You didn't have to name me" callback planted
- Ending: "Whatever happens, we walk in as family."

### Speculative Discussion
- Explored "Bedtime Story AI" corruption concept — not resolved, left open

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Admiral Tien (not Chen) | Chapter prose is source of truth |
| Four/Elena banter = mutual affection | "Robot uprising handbook" bit establishes dynamic |

---

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `/workspaces/pilot/RESONANCE/data/CHAPTERS.yaml` | ADMIRAL_CHEN → ADMIRAL_TIEN (2 occurrences) |

---

## Open Threads

### Immediate
- [ ] Finalize "Before the Verdict" scene
- [ ] Add POV declarations to chapter headers for validator
- [ ] Update HANDOFF.md to reflect Ch 22 is complete

### From Earlier Sessions
- [ ] Four hot-swaps out of VTOL (Chekhov's gun)
- [ ] Previous emergence 60 years ago in Geneva — who/what?
- [ ] Dante's sacrifice scene
- [ ] Ash/Standard confrontation
- [ ] "The Gift" specifics — what exactly does Standard offer?

---

## Character States (Unchanged from Session 10)

| Character | Location | State |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Standard | Deliverance | Playing messiah, gave speech (Ch 22), "I'm THE Standard" |
| Hendricks | Deliverance | Healthy 60-65, father role acknowledged |
| Elena | Deliverance | PTSD, escape plan forming, publicly disowned Ash |
| Four | VTOL in hangar | Accessing systems, changed by Geometry |
| Ash | Quiet Zone | Has revolver, activated Black Box camouflage, refused the gift |

---

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Clarify remaining chapter count** — how many chapters to the ending?
2. **Scaffold Act III** — path from Council to Ash confrontation to ending
3. **Nail down "The Gift"** — what Standard specifically offers
4. **Dante's sacrifice** — where and how?

## Session Notes

Light session focused on validation, refinement, and mapping remaining work. No new prose finalized. Key discovery: Chapter 22 already exists but wasn't reflected in HANDOFF's "last chapters written" section.

The Four/Elena banter exchange landed — "robot uprising handbook" is the right register for their dynamic.

The "Bedtime Story AI" question suggests potential new plot element but wasn't developed.

Ready to scaffold remaining chapters next session.
