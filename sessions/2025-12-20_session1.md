# SESSION REFLECTION: 2025-12-20 (Session 1)

**Duration:** Extended session
**Focus:** Project setup, context engineering, Chapter 4

---

## WORK COMPLETED

### Context Engineering
- Read complete Book 1 (Remanence, ~120K words)
- Created REMANENCE context engineering system (Entity Catalog, Constraints, Evaluator, Manifest template)
- Read existing RESONANCE materials (Chapters 1-3, Codex, trackers)
- Created RESONANCE context engineering system
- Integrated Codex v1 into HANDOFF.md

### Writing
- Drafted Chapter 4: The Convergence (~1,650 words)
- Elena POV at checkpoint, loading Standard and Hendricks into rover
- Seeds planted: Hendricks bomb, The Void sensation, "Formatting Scheduled"

### Character Work
- Created character profile template
- Split 4 character documents into profiles (stable) and state (dynamic)
- Final structure: `characters/profiles/` and `characters/state/`

### Session 1 Locks (Canonical)
- Elena age: 18 (was 17 during The Miracle)
- Elena experience: First major operation (NOT veteran)
- Hendricks Bomb: Elena does NOT know Hendricks shot the Child

### Folder Organization
- Organized RESONANCE into chapters/, characters/, context/, manifests/
- Established pilot-level files: claude.md, HANDOFF.md, sessions/

## KEY DECISIONS

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Elena is 18, first operation | Heightens Abraham/Isaac dynamic; she's a child soldier, not veteran |
| Hendricks Bomb as constraint | Major reveal must be protected; detection patterns added |
| Profiles vs State split | Profiles = permanent identity; State = updates per chapter |
| Session files at pilot level | Trilogy-wide, not book-specific |

---

## CREATIVE DYNAMICS

- User provides structural vision; Claude extrapolates and writes prose
- Context engineering prevents hallucination/drift
- "Inertia Check" — everything must follow from Remanence events
- User corrects drift quickly (e.g., Elena's age, experience level)

---

## OPEN THREADS

- Brother Ash's TBD fields (ethnicity, sexuality) need filling before he appears on page
- Chapter 5 not started (arrival at compound)
- Ash's compound physical description needed
- The Drop mechanics TBD

---

## NEXT SESSION

1. Fill Brother Ash TBDs before writing him
2. Create Chapter 5 manifest
3. Write Chapter 5 (arrival at Ash's compound)
4. Update state files after Chapter 5
