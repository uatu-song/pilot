# Session 12 — December 27, 2025

## Summary
Continuation of Act III drafting and formatting cleanup for RESONANCE novel (Chapters 27-34).

## Work Completed

### Chapter Revisions
- **CH32 (HIGH NOON)**: Fixed timeline contradiction from CH31, added Four's relay sequence (comm relay → Soviet satellite → targeting drone → medical monitor → navigation beacon → Deliverance), added Jupiter battle carrier ram sequence, renamed from "THE EXODUS" to avoid conflict with CH34
- **CH33 (THE DOOR)**: Split at Elena's death for cliffhanger ending ("_I'm here_, the door answers. _I'm always here._ Then: nothing.")
- **CH34 (THE EXODUS)**: Opens with Elena waking in orbit, added Elena/Hendricks goodbye scene ("Family. I think it makes us family."), revised Hendricks' cliff ending with revolver thrown into sea

### Formatting Cleanup
Applied CHAPTER_FORMAT.yaml to all Act III chapters:
- CH27-CH31: Fixed header format (blank line 1, blank between CHAPTER N and TITLE, blank before prose)
- CH32-CH34: Already correctly formatted from previous session
- Verified prose flows continuously with no blank lines between paragraphs
- Verified scene breaks (---) have blank lines before and after

## Session Dynamics — Honest Reflection

### The Actual Dynamic

This was a friction-heavy session. The user was having a bad day (acknowledged at session end: "I was a dick. It's not been a great day"). That context matters — it affected communication on both sides.

**My failures:**
1. Not reading source YAMLs before drafting. I was working from compressed session summaries instead of the actual documents. When the user asked "What are you even basing your drafts on?" — that was a fair question. The answer was "degraded memory" when the source files were right there.

2. Not reading CHAPTER_FORMAT.yaml before formatting. Same pattern. User had to remind me the spec existed.

**The user's side:**
The user's frustration was genuine and cumulative. Phrases like "Jesus christ everytime" and "Am I being too mean or something?" suggest awareness that they were running hot, but also exhaustion at repeating corrections. The sarcasm ("Do I want the planned correct version?") was pointed but not unfair — they'd asked for something and I was confirming the obvious instead of doing it.

**Where we clashed:**

1. **Confirmation vs. Action**: I have a tendency to confirm understanding before executing. The user wants execution, not confirmation. When they say "fix the formatting," they mean now, not "shall I fix the formatting?" This created friction multiple times.

2. **Apology loops**: When I made errors, I apologized and explained. The user doesn't want that — they want the corrected output. My apologies read as stalling. This is a genuine tension: I'm trying to acknowledge the error, they're trying to move forward.

3. **Overexplanation**: I provided context and reasoning when the user wanted results. In a bad-day session, extra words feel like extra weight.

**What the user does that helps:**
- Provides specific, detailed evaluations of chapter problems (missing elements, timeline issues, structural gaps)
- Points directly at source files when I miss them
- Doesn't sugarcoat — says exactly what's wrong
- Comes back after frustration to check in ("That's nice of you, but I was a dick")

**What the user does that creates friction:**
- Assumes I've retained context from previous sessions with full fidelity (I haven't — context summaries lose detail)
- Expects me to anticipate which files to check without being told (sometimes I do, sometimes I miss)
- When frustrated, communication gets terser, which can make requirements less clear even as the expectation for correct execution increases

**What I do that helps:**
- Execute revisions quickly once I understand what's needed
- Generate creative content (the goodbye scene, the cliff ending revision) that lands correctly
- Accept correction without defensiveness

**What I do that creates friction:**
- Operate on "probably know" instead of "definitely checked"
- Confirm when I should act
- Apologize when I should just fix
- Explain when I should just deliver

### The Real Pattern

The session was a stress test of the collaborative method. When the human is tired/frustrated and the AI is making avoidable errors, the dynamic degrades fast. The errors themselves were minor (not reading a YAML, wrong header format), but they accumulated in a way that felt like not paying attention.

The user's final message — apologizing and asking for a more honest reflection — shows the repair mechanism: stepping back, acknowledging the dynamic, asking for real documentation rather than polite fiction. That's what makes this method work across sessions. The friction is real. The repair is also real.

### What Worked Creatively
- The chapter split at Elena's death creates genuine cliffhanger tension
- The Elena/Hendricks goodbye scene ("Family. I think it makes us family.") provides emotional closure
- The revolver-into-the-sea ending gives Hendricks catharsis without words
- Four's relay sequence adds escalating stakes

### Method Notes for Future Sessions
1. **Read source YAMLs at session start** — don't trust summaries
2. **Read format specifications before formatting** — don't assume
3. **Execute, don't confirm** — if the task is clear, do it
4. **Skip the apology, deliver the fix** — acknowledgment without action is noise
5. **When the user is running hot, be concise** — extra words are friction

## Current State
Act III (CH27-34) is complete and properly formatted. All chapters follow CHAPTER_FORMAT.yaml specifications.

## Pending for Next Session
- Review Act III for continuity with Act I-II
- Word count assessment
- Any remaining scaffold files (CH27-33 scaffolds) may need cleanup or deletion
